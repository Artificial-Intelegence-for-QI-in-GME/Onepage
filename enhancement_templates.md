## Template Application Guidelines

### For Each Prompt Enhancement:
1. **Identify Base Category** (A, B, C, D, or E)
2. **Read the Strong Version** carefully to understand core requirements
3. **Apply Appropriate Template** while building upon (not replacing) strong version
4. **Customize Domain Elements** based on specific healthcare context
5. **Validate Enhancement Value** - ensure enhanced is clearly superior to strong

### Quality Checklist:
- [ ] Enhanced version builds upon (doesn't replace) strong version
- [ ] Complexity matches task requirements  
- [ ] Uses modern prompt engineering techniques appropriately
- [ ] Includes healthcare-specific considerations where relevant
- [ ] Provides clear, actionable guidance
- [ ] Maintains focus on specific deliverable
- [ ] Language is professional and accessible
- [ ] Output format is structured and usable

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
- Don't use generic templates for specific tasks
- Don't add complexity for complexity's sake
- Don't lose the core task focus in frameworks
- Don't assume all tasks need comprehensive QI methodology
- Don't ignore the strong version's strengths
- Don't make prompts harder to use with excessive structure
