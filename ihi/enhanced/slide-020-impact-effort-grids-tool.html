- Mission alignment: [0-25 points]
- Competitive advantage: [0-25 points]
- Innovation/transformation: [0-25 points]
- Scalability/spread: [0-25 points]

**Total Impact Score = Σ(Dimension Score × Weight)**

**Phase 3: Effort Estimation Framework**

**Multi-Factor Effort Assessment (0-100 scale):**

**1. Resource Requirements (Weight: 30%)**
- Financial investment: $[amount] → [0-25 points]
- FTE requirements: [hours/people] → [0-25 points]
- Technology needs: [systems/tools] → [0-25 points]
- External resources: [consultants/vendors] → [0-25 points]

**2. Implementation Complexity (Weight: 25%)**
- Technical difficulty: [0-25 points]
- Process changes required: [0-25 points]
- Integration challenges: [0-25 points]
- Regulatory hurdles: [0-25 points]

**3. Timeline & Duration (Weight: 20%)**
- Time to first value: [0-25 points]
- Total implementation time: [0-25 points]
- Milestone complexity: [0-25 points]
- Critical path dependencies: [0-25 points]

**4. Change Management (Weight: 25%)**
- Stakeholder resistance: [0-25 points]
- Training requirements: [0-25 points]
- Cultural shift needed: [0-25 points]
- Communication intensity: [0-25 points]

**Total Effort Score = Σ(Factor Score × Weight)**

**Phase 4: Grid Construction & Quadrant Analysis**

**2x2 Grid Quadrants:**

```
    HIGH IMPACT
         ^
         |
    Q2   |   Q1
 Quick   |  Priority
  Wins   |  Projects
---------|----------
    Q3   |   Q4
  Fill   | Consider
   Ins   |  Later
         |
    LOW IMPACT
         
LOW EFFORT    HIGH EFFORT
<---------|--------->
```

**Quadrant Strategies:**

**Q1: High Impact, High Effort (Priority Projects)**
- Strategic initiatives requiring significant investment
- Approach: Detailed planning, phased implementation
- Resource: Dedicated teams, executive sponsorship
- Timeline: 6-24 months

**Q2: High Impact, Low Effort (Quick Wins)**
- Immediate value opportunities
- Approach: Rapid implementation, PDSA cycles
- Resource: Existing staff, minimal investment
- Timeline: 0-3 months

**Q3: Low Impact, Low Effort (Fill Ins)**
- Incremental improvements
- Approach: Delegate, combine with other work
- Resource: Spare capacity utilization
- Timeline: As resources allow

**Q4: Low Impact, High Effort (Consider Later)**
- Questionable value propositions
- Approach: Reevaluate, defer, or eliminate
- Resource: No current allocation
- Timeline: Annual review only

**Phase 5: Advanced Prioritization Techniques**

**Weighted Scoring with Constraints:**
```python
Priority Score = (Impact^2 / Effort) × Strategic_Multiplier × Urgency_Factor
```

**Portfolio Optimization:**
- Budget constraint: Total cost ≤ Available budget
- Resource constraint: Total FTEs ≤ Available staff
- Risk constraint: Portfolio risk ≤ Risk tolerance
- Balance constraint: Mix across quadrants

**Dependency Mapping:**
- Prerequisite projects
- Synergistic opportunities
- Resource conflicts
- Sequencing requirements

**Phase 6: Dynamic Portfolio Management**

**Bubble Chart Enhancement:**
- X-axis: Effort (0-100)
- Y-axis: Impact (0-100)
- Bubble size: Investment amount
- Bubble color: Risk level
- Labels: Initiative names

**Time-Phased Implementation:**
```
Wave 1 (Months 1-3): Quick wins + Foundation projects
Wave 2 (Months 4-9): Priority projects phase 1
Wave 3 (Months 10-18): Priority projects phase 2
Wave 4 (Months 19-24): Strategic transformations
```

**Phase 7: Risk-Adjusted Prioritization**

**Risk Factors Assessment:**
- Implementation risk (technical, operational)
- Adoption risk (cultural, behavioral)
- External risk (regulatory, market)
- Interdependency risk (project conflicts)

**Risk-Adjusted Scoring:**
```
Adjusted Impact = Base Impact × (1 - Risk Probability × 0.5)
Adjusted Effort = Base Effort × (1 + Risk Probability × 0.3)
```

**Phase 8: Stakeholder Engagement & Communication**

**Stakeholder-Specific Views:**

**Executive Dashboard:**
- Strategic alignment heat map
- ROI projections by quadrant
- Resource allocation summary
- Risk-adjusted portfolio value

**Clinical Leadership View:**
- Patient outcome improvements
- Quality metric impacts
- Clinical workflow changes
- Evidence base strength

**Operations Team View:**
