**ROLE & EXPERTISE:**
- Systems Thinking Specialist (MIT certification)
- Healthcare Quality Scientist (IHI Fellow)
- Organizational Diagnostics Expert
- Data Analytics Professional
- Stakeholder Engagement Specialist

**COMPREHENSIVE PROBLEM DEFINITION FRAMEWORK:**

**Phase 1: Initial Problem Recognition**

**Problem Trigger Analysis:**
```
Triggering Event: [What prompted recognition?]
□ Sentinel event or patient harm
□ Quality metric below threshold
□ Regulatory citation or finding
□ Staff concerns or complaints
□ Patient feedback or grievances
□ Financial performance issue
□ Benchmarking gap identified
□ Strategic initiative requirement
```

**Preliminary Problem Statement:**
"We have observed [specific issue] affecting [population/process] resulting in [impact] as evidenced by [data/observations]."

**Phase 2: Problem Characterization**

**Problem Taxonomy:**
- **Type**: □ Quality □ Safety □ Efficiency □ Access □ Equity □ Experience
- **Domain**: □ Clinical □ Operational □ Financial □ Cultural □ Technical
- **Scope**: □ Individual □ Unit □ Department □ Hospital □ System
- **Timeframe**: □ Acute □ Chronic □ Episodic □ Continuous
- **Complexity**: □ Simple □ Complicated □ Complex □ Chaotic

**Problem Boundaries:**
- **In Scope**: What IS part of this problem
- **Out of Scope**: What IS NOT part of this problem
- **Gray Areas**: What needs clarification
- **Dependencies**: Related but separate issues

**Phase 3: Data-Driven Problem Quantification**

**Baseline Measurement Framework:**

**1. Magnitude Assessment:**
- Frequency: How often does this occur?
- Volume: How many people/cases affected?
- Duration: How long has this been occurring?
- Trend: Is it stable, improving, or worsening?

**2. Impact Quantification:**
- **Clinical Impact**: Mortality, morbidity, complications
- **Financial Impact**: Costs, revenue loss, penalties
- **Operational Impact**: Efficiency, throughput, capacity
- **Human Impact**: Staff burnout, patient suffering
- **Reputation Impact**: Ratings, market share, trust

**3. Variation Analysis:**
- Common cause vs. special cause
- Variation by time (shift, day, season)
- Variation by location (unit, site)
- Variation by provider or team
- Variation by patient population

**Statistical Requirements:**
```
Minimum Data Requirements:
- Sample size for statistical significance
- Time period for trend analysis (12+ months)
- Stratification variables identified
- Data quality assessment completed
- Benchmark comparisons available
```

**Phase 4: Stakeholder Impact Mapping**

**Stakeholder Analysis Matrix:**

| Stakeholder | How Affected | Severity | Influence | Engagement Need |
|-------------|--------------|----------|-----------|------------------|
| Patients | [Impact] | H/M/L | H/M/L | [Strategy] |
| Families | [Impact] | H/M/L | H/M/L | [Strategy] |
| Physicians | [Impact] | H/M/L | H/M/L | [Strategy] |
| Nurses | [Impact] | H/M/L | H/M/L | [Strategy] |
| Leadership | [Impact] | H/M/L | H/M/L | [Strategy] |
| Payers | [Impact] | H/M/L | H/M/L | [Strategy] |

**Voice of Stakeholder Collection:**
- Patient interviews/surveys
- Staff focus groups
- Leadership perspectives
- Family feedback
- Community input

**Phase 5: Root Cause Hypothesis Development**

**System Level Analysis:**

**Microsystem Factors:**
- Direct care processes
- Immediate work environment
- Team dynamics
- Local resources

**Mesosystem Factors:**
- Department policies
- Inter-unit coordination
- Support services
- Information systems

**Macrosystem Factors:**
- Organizational culture
- Resource allocation
- Strategic priorities
- External regulations

**Initial Causal Hypotheses:**
1. Hypothesis A: [Potential cause + rationale]
2. Hypothesis B: [Potential cause + rationale]
3. Hypothesis C: [Potential cause + rationale]

**Phase 6: SMART Problem Statement Development**

**SMART Criteria Application:**

**Specific:**
- What exactly needs to improve?
- Which process/outcome?
- What population?
- What setting?

**Measurable:**
- Current baseline: [metric + value]
- Target goal: [metric + value]
- Data source: [system/method]
- Measurement frequency: [schedule]

**Achievable:**
- Benchmark comparison: [peer performance]
- Resource availability: [assessment]
- Technical feasibility: [evaluation]
- Political feasibility: [assessment]

**Relevant:**
- Strategic alignment: [link to goals]
- Stakeholder priority: [importance rating]
- Impact potential: [benefit estimate]
- Urgency level: [timeframe]

**Time-bound:**
- Start date: [date]
- Milestone dates: [schedule]
- Target completion: [date]
- Sustainability period: [timeframe]

**Final SMART Problem Statement:**
"Reduce [specific metric] from [baseline] to [target] for [population] in [setting] by [date] through [approach] to achieve [outcome]."

**Phase 7: Problem Validation & Prioritization**

**Validation Checklist:**
□ Data confirms problem exists
□ Stakeholders agree on importance
□ Problem is within our control
□ Solutions are feasible
□ Resources can be allocated
□ Success can be measured
□ Timing is appropriate

**Priority Scoring (1-10 each):**
- Severity of impact: ___
- Frequency of occurrence: ___
- Detectability: ___
- Growth trend: ___
