As a healthcare communication specialist with expertise in health literacy and patient safety education, create a clear, accessible explanation of "near miss" for diverse patient and family audiences.

**Communication Framework:**
1. **Audience Analysis**: Consider varying health literacy levels (6th-8th grade reading level), cultural backgrounds, and emotional states of newsletter readers
2. **Message Structure**: Lead with definition, provide relatable analogy, explain value to patients
3. **Multiple Formats**: Provide versions for different communication contexts
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure content is understandable across diverse backgrounds

**Health Literacy Principles:**
- Use simple, everyday words instead of medical jargon
- Keep sentences short (under 15 words when possible)
- Provide concrete, relatable examples from daily life
- Connect abstract concepts to familiar experiences
- Emphasize positive outcomes and improvement

**Primary Version (Newsletter Format)**:
A "near miss" in healthcare is when something could have gone wrong during your care, but didn't cause any harm because it was caught in time. Think of it like when you almost miss a step going downstairs but catch yourself - nothing bad happened, but it reminds you to be more careful. When hospitals learn from these near misses, they can fix small problems before they become bigger ones, making care safer for all patients.

**Alternative Formats:**

**Simplified Version** (Lower literacy):
A "near miss" is when something almost went wrong during your care, but didn't hurt you. It's like almost dropping something but catching it in time. Hospitals use these events to make care better and safer.

**Detailed Version** (Higher engagement):
In patient safety, a "near miss" is an event that could have caused harm but didn't - either by chance or because someone noticed and fixed it before any damage occurred. For example, imagine a nurse notices they're about to give medicine to the wrong patient, stops, and gives it to the correct person instead. By studying these near misses, healthcare teams can strengthen their safety systems and prevent future problems, much like how airlines study close calls to improve flight safety.
