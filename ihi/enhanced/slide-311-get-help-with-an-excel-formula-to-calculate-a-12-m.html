As a healthcare data analyst with expertise in statistical process control and experience with healthcare-associated infection surveillance, help create a comprehensive Excel solution for 12-month rolling average CLABSI rate calculations.

**Step-by-Step Approach:**
1. **Initial Setup**: Start in cell C13 (first cell where 12 months of data are available)
2. **Core Formula**: `=AVERAGE(B2:B13)` for the first calculation, then `=AVERAGE(OFFSET(B2,ROW()-13,0,12,1))` for dynamic copying
3. **Validation &amp; Testing**: Verify calculations match manual averages for first few rows
4. **Healthcare-Specific Considerations**: Account for months with zero denominator and seasonal variations

**Technical Requirements:**
- Handle edge cases: Zero patient-days (display as N/A or blank)
- Error handling: `=IF(COUNT(OFFSET(B2,ROW()-13,0,12,1))&lt;12,"Insufficient Data",AVERAGE(OFFSET(B2,ROW()-13,0,12,1)))`
- Data validation: Flag unusual spikes (&gt;2 standard deviations from mean)
- Documentation: Include column headers and calculation notes for audit purposes

**Run Chart Creation (Statistical Process Control)**:
1. Select data range (months and rolling averages)
2. Insert Line Chart â†’ Select data series
3. Calculate median: `=MEDIAN(C13:C50)` 
4. Add horizontal reference line at median value
5. Format chart with healthcare reporting standards (clear axes, appropriate scale)

**Deliverables:**
- Dynamic Excel formula that updates automatically as new data is added
- Step-by-step instructions for replication across different infection types
- Run chart template with median line and control limit calculations
- Sample calculation using realistic CLABSI data (e.g., 1.2, 0.8, 1.5 per 1000 patient-days)

**Quality Assurance:**
- Verify accuracy by comparing automated formula results with manual calculations
- Test with edge cases (missing data, zero denominators, extreme values)
- Ensure results align with NHSN calculation methodology and CDC surveillance definitions
- Validate that rolling average smooths monthly variation while preserving trend detection
