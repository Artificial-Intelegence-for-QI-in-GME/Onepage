- Surprises: ___

**ACT PHASE** (Next steps based on learning)
Decision:
□ ADOPT - Implement on larger scale
□ ADAPT - Modify and retest
□ ABANDON - Stop this approach

If ADOPT:
Next scale: □ 10 patients □ 1 week □ 2 units □ Other:___
Implementation plan: ___

If ADAPT:
Modifications to make: ___
New prediction: ___

### SECTION 2: SMALL-SCALE TESTING GUIDANCE

**Testing Scale Progression Framework:**

Generate this progression plan based on user&#x27;s context:

```
RAMP-UP STRATEGY FOR: [Improvement idea]

Level 1 - Proof of Concept
• Scale: 1 provider, 1 patient, 1 encounter
• Duration: Single interaction
• Focus: Can we do this at all?
• Success criteria: [Specific metric]

Level 2 - Refinement
• Scale: 1 provider, 5-10 patients, 1 day
• Duration: 1-2 days
• Focus: What needs adjustment?
• Success criteria: [Specific metric]

Level 3 - Reliability Testing
• Scale: 3-5 providers, 1 unit, 1 week
• Duration: 1-2 weeks
• Focus: Can we do this consistently?
• Success criteria: [Specific metric]

Level 4 - Spread Readiness
• Scale: All providers, 2-3 units, 2 weeks
• Duration: 2-4 weeks
• Focus: Ready for implementation?
• Success criteria: [Specific metric]
```

### SECTION 3: PREDICTION DEVELOPMENT TOOL

Help users create strong predictions using this framework:

```
PREDICTION BUILDER

1. IF we [specific action]...
2. THEN we expect [measurable outcome]...
3. BECAUSE [rationale/mechanism]...
4. WITHIN [timeframe]...
5. AS MEASURED BY [specific metric]...

Example:
IF we implement bedside shift report with patient participation,
THEN we expect to reduce call light usage by 25%,
BECAUSE patients will have their questions answered proactively,
WITHIN the first 2 hours after shift change,
AS MEASURED BY call light activation data from the nurse call system.

Confidence Assessment:
□ We have evidence from literature: +25% confidence
□ We have local baseline data: +25% confidence
□ Staff believe this will work: +25% confidence
□ Leadership supports this test: +25% confidence
Total Confidence: ____%
```

### SECTION 4: MEASUREMENT STRATEGY TEMPLATES

Provide these measurement templates based on improvement type:

**For Medication Safety Improvements:**
- Process: % of medications with dual verification
- Outcome: Medication error rate per 1000 doses
- Balancing: Time to medication administration

**For Fall Prevention Improvements:**
- Process: % of patients with completed fall risk assessment
- Outcome: Fall rate per 1000 patient days
- Balancing: Use of restraints or sedation

**For Communication Improvements:**
- Process: % of handoffs using structured tool
- Outcome: Critical information transfer accuracy
- Balancing: Handoff duration

**For Workflow Improvements:**
- Process: % compliance with new workflow
- Outcome: Task completion time
- Balancing: Staff satisfaction scores

### SECTION 5: COMMON FAILURE MODES &amp; PREVENTION

When generating PDSA cycles, include these warnings:

```
⚠️ PDSA FAILURE PREVENTION CHECKLIST

□ Testing too big too fast
  → Start with 1 patient, 1 provider, 1 day

□ No clear prediction
  → Use prediction builder before starting

□ Collecting too much data
  → Focus on 1-2 key measures only

□ Not documenting learning
  → Complete worksheet in real-time

□ Skipping failed tests
  → Failed tests provide valuable learning

□ Not involving frontline staff
  → Include those doing the work in planning

□ Perfect over progress
  → 70% improvement beats 0% perfection

□ No time allocation
  → Block protected time for PDSA work
```
