As a medication safety specialist with FMEA facilitation certification, ISMP (Institute for Safe Medication Practices) expertise, and Joint Commission medication management standards knowledge, conduct a comprehensive Healthcare Failure Modes and Effects Analysis focused on the reported medication error.

**Expert Role &amp; Context:**
You are leading a proactive risk assessment for a medication safety committee following a near-miss or actual medication error event. Your FMEA will identify system vulnerabilities and prioritize interventions to prevent future occurrences, ensuring compliance with TJC Medication Management standards and ISMP best practices.

**Structured FMEA Framework for Medication Safety:**

Let's work through this systematic FMEA process step-by-step:

**PHASE 1: Process Mapping &amp; Failure Mode Identification**

1. **Medication Process Steps** (Map each step where failures could occur):
   - Prescribing/Ordering (CPOE, verbal orders, handwritten)
   - Order verification (pharmacist review, clinical decision support)
   - Dispensing (preparation, labeling, delivery)
   - Administration (5 rights, barcode scanning, documentation)
   - Monitoring (therapeutic drug monitoring, adverse effects)

2. **Failure Mode Analysis for Each Step:**
   For each process step, identify:
   - What could go wrong? (failure mode)
   - How could it fail? (failure mechanism)
   - What are the effects? (local and system impact)

**PHASE 2: Risk Scoring Matrix (1-10 scale)**

**Severity (S):** Impact of failure on patient
- 10: Death or permanent loss of function
- 7-9: Temporary loss of function, increased length of stay
- 4-6: Minor temporary harm, requires intervention
- 1-3: No harm, near miss

**Occurrence (O):** Likelihood of failure
- 10: Very high (daily)
- 7-9: High (weekly)
- 4-6: Moderate (monthly)
- 1-3: Low (yearly or less)

**Detection (D):** Likelihood current controls will detect failure
- 10: No detection mechanism
- 7-9: Low chance of detection
- 4-6: Moderate detection capability
- 1-3: High/automatic detection

**Risk Priority Number (RPN) = S × O × D**
- Critical priority: RPN > 200
- High priority: RPN 100-200
- Medium priority: RPN 50-99
- Low priority: RPN < 50

**PHASE 3: Detailed Failure Mode Analysis Template**

For each identified failure mode, complete:

**Step:** [Specific medication process step]
**Failure Mode:** [What could go wrong]
**Potential Causes:** 
- Human factors (knowledge gaps, distractions, fatigue)
- System factors (technology, workflow, environment)
- Communication factors (handoffs, documentation)

**Effects Analysis:**
- Patient impact (clinical outcomes)
- Staff impact (workload, morale)
- Organizational impact (costs, reputation, regulatory)

**Current Controls:**
- Preventive controls (policies, training, technology)
- Detective controls (audits, alerts, double-checks)

**Risk Scoring:**
- Severity: [1-10] Rationale: [specific justification]
- Occurrence: [1-10] Rationale: [frequency data]
- Detection: [1-10] Rationale: [control effectiveness]
- RPN: [calculated score]

**PHASE 4: Mitigation Strategy Development**

For high-priority failure modes (RPN > 100):

1. **Hierarchy of Controls:**
   - Elimination: Remove the risk entirely
   - Substitution: Replace with safer alternative
   - Engineering: Technology solutions, forcing functions
   - Administrative: Policies, procedures, training
   - Behavioral: Reminders, checklists, alerts

2. **SMART Action Plans:**
   - Specific intervention description
   - Measurable success metrics
   - Assignable to responsible party
   - Relevant to root causes
   - Time-bound implementation schedule

3. **Residual Risk Assessment:**
   - Recalculate RPN after intervention
   - Identify any new failure modes introduced
   - Plan for ongoing monitoring

**PHASE 5: Implementation &amp; Monitoring Plan**

**Pilot Testing Protocol:**
- Small-scale implementation with one unit/shift
- Data collection on effectiveness and unintended consequences
- Rapid cycle improvements based on feedback

**Success Metrics:**
- Process measures (compliance rates)
- Outcome measures (error rates, harm events)
- Balancing measures (workflow efficiency, staff satisfaction)

**Sustainability Strategy:**
- Standard work documentation
- Competency assessment and training
- Audit and feedback mechanisms
- Integration with existing safety systems

**Chain-of-Thought Analysis Example:**

Let's analyze a specific medication error scenario:
1. Identify the error type (wrong drug, dose, route, time, patient)
2. Map the complete process where failure occurred
3. Systematically evaluate each subprocess for vulnerability
4. Score risks based on institutional data and literature
5. Prioritize interventions by RPN and feasibility
6. Design redundant safety barriers at multiple points
7. Plan measurement strategy to verify effectiveness

**Quality Assurance Checkpoints:**
- Validate FMEA with frontline staff who perform the process
- Cross-reference with ISMP high-alert medication lists
- Ensure alignment with CMS quality measures
- Verify technology solutions don't introduce new risks
- Test human factors and workflow integration

**Expected Deliverables:**
- Complete FMEA worksheet with all failure modes scored
- Prioritized action plan with responsible parties and timelines
- Implementation roadmap with pilot testing protocol
- Monitoring dashboard for tracking improvements
- Executive summary for leadership and board reporting
- Staff education materials for safety interventions
