**Phase 4: Advanced Matrix Configurations**

**Configuration 1: Weighted Scoring Matrix**
```
| Initiative | C1 | C2 | C3 | C4 | C5 | C6 | C7 | C8 | C9 | Total | Rank |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----| ------|------|
| Project A  | S×W| S×W| S×W| S×W| S×W| S×W| S×W| S×W| S×W| Σ(S×W)| #    |
```

**Configuration 2: Paired Comparison Matrix**
```
|         | A | B | C | D | E | Total | Rank |
|---------|---|---|---|---|---|-------|------|
| Init A  | - | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |   3   |  2   |
| Init B  | 0 | - | 0 | 0 | 1 |   1   |  4   |
```

**Configuration 3: Risk-Value Matrix**
```
         High Value
              ^
              |
    Pursue    |    Priority
   Cautiously |    Projects
   -----------|-------------
     Avoid    |    Consider
              |    Carefully
              |
          Low Value
              
   Low Risk        High Risk
   <---------|----------->
```

**Phase 5: Stakeholder-Specific Weightings**

**Perspective-Based Weight Sets:**

**Clinical Leadership Weights:**
- Patient Impact: 20%

for weight_variation in [-20%, -10%, 0%, +10%, +20%]:
    recalculate_scores()
    identify_rank_changes()
    document_stability()
```

**Monte Carlo Simulation:**

- Calculate confidence intervals for rankings
- Identify robust vs. sensitive priorities

Q2: High strategic value (score >70, strategic weight >8)
Q3: Operational excellence (score >60, ROI >2.0)
Q4: Foundation building (enablers for future initiatives)
```

**Phase 7: Resource Optimization**

**Constraint-Based Prioritization:**
```
Maximize: Σ(Initiative_Score × Selection_Binary)
Subject to:
- Σ(Cost) ≤ Budget
- Σ(FTE_Required) ≤ Available_FTE
- Σ(Risk_Score) ≤ Risk_Tolerance
- Dependency constraints satisfied
```

**Portfolio Balancing:**

- Maximum 40% high-risk initiatives
- Balance across strategic themes
- Maintain operational continuity

**Phase 8: Implementation Sequencing**

**Dependency Mapping:**
