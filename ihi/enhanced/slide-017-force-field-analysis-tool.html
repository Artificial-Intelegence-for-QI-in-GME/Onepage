**Force Field Diagram:**
```
DRIVING FORCES                    RESTRAINING FORCES
(Supporting Change)               (Opposing Change)
                                 
Regulatory Mandate    ====>8<====3  Budget Constraints
Quality Gaps          ====>7<====6  Change Fatigue
Leadership Support    ====>9<====4  Skill Gaps
Patient Demand        ====>6<====7  Cultural Resistance
Efficiency Gains      ====>5<====5  Technical Barriers
Competitive Pressure  ====>4<====8  Workflow Disruption
                                 
TOTAL DRIVING: 39     <===>     TOTAL RESTRAINING: 33
                                 
NET FORCE: +6 (Favorable for change)
```

**Force Balance Analysis:**
- Total Driving Force: Σ[DF scores]
- Total Restraining Force: Σ[RF scores]
- Net Force: Driving - Restraining
- Critical Ratio: Driving/Restraining

**Interpretation:**
- Net Force > +10: Strong momentum, proceed confidently
- Net Force +5 to +10: Moderate momentum, proceed with support
- Net Force -5 to +5: Balanced, requires intervention
- Net Force < -5: Significant resistance, reconsider approach

**Phase 5: Stakeholder Force Mapping**

**Stakeholder Influence Matrix:**

| Stakeholder Group | Driving Force | Restraining Force | Net Position | Influence Level |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|
| Executive Team | +8 | -2 | +6 | High |
| Medical Staff | +3 | -6 | -3 | High |
| Nursing Staff | +5 | -4 | +1 | Medium |
| Support Staff | +2 | -7 | -5 | Low |
| Patients/Families | +7 | -1 | +6 | Medium |

Weighted_Force = Force_Strength × Stakeholder_Influence × Changeability_Factor
```

**Scenario Planning:**
- Best case: All controllable forces optimized
- Worst case: Maximum resistance encountered
- Most likely: Realistic force expectations
