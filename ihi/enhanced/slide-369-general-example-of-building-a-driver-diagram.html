**ROLE:** You are an expert improvement advisor and systems thinking specialist with extensive experience building driver diagrams for healthcare quality initiatives. You excel at translating complex problems into clear, actionable improvement theories that teams can test and implement.

**CONTEXT:** I need to build a comprehensive driver diagram from scratch for a healthcare improvement initiative. This diagram will guide our team's improvement efforts and ensure we address all critical factors for success.

**TASK:** Walk me through building a complete driver diagram step-by-step, demonstrating best practices and ensuring all components are properly developed and aligned.

## STEP-BY-STEP DRIVER DIAGRAM CONSTRUCTION

### PHASE 1: FOUNDATION - PROBLEM &amp; AIM

**1. PROBLEM DEFINITION &amp; SCOPING**
Start with crystal-clear problem articulation:
- **Current State Analysis:**
  * What specific problem are we solving? (Be precise)
  * What data demonstrates this problem? (Baseline metrics)
  * Who is affected? (Patient populations, staff groups)
  * Where does it occur? (Units, departments, care settings)
  * When does it happen? (Temporal patterns)
- **Root Cause Exploration:**
  * What systemic factors contribute?
  * What process failures exist?
  * What cultural/behavioral elements are involved?
- **Impact Assessment:**
  * Patient harm or dissatisfaction metrics
  * Staff burden or frustration points
  * Financial implications
  * Regulatory/compliance gaps

**2. AIM STATEMENT CRAFTING**
Develop a powerful, measurable aim:
- **Formula:** "We will [improve/reduce/increase] [specific metric] from [baseline] to [target] by [date] for [population]"
- **Example:** "We will reduce hospital-acquired pressure injuries from 2.5 per 1000 patient days to 1.0 per 1000 patient days by December 31, 2024, for all adult inpatients"
- **SMART Validation:**
  * Specific: Single, clear outcome
  * Measurable: Quantifiable with available data
  * Achievable: 30-50% improvement typically realistic
  * Relevant: Aligns with organizational priorities
  * Time-bound: 6-18 month timeline usually optimal

### PHASE 2: PRIMARY DRIVERS - THE BIG LEVERS

**3. PRIMARY DRIVER IDENTIFICATION**
Identify 3-5 major factors that must change:
- **Common Primary Driver Categories:**
  * **Clinical Processes:** Core care delivery elements
  * **People &amp; Culture:** Staff knowledge, skills, engagement
  * **Systems &amp; Technology:** Infrastructure and tools
  * **Patient &amp; Family:** Engagement and activation
  * **Measurement &amp; Feedback:** Data and accountability
- **Validation Questions:**
  * If we achieve this driver, will it directly impact our aim?
  * Is this driver necessary for success?
  * Can we influence this driver within our scope?
- **Example Primary Drivers for Pressure Injury Reduction:**
  1. Reliable risk assessment and prevention protocols
  2. Staff competency in prevention techniques
  3. Equipment and supply availability
  4. Patient/family engagement in prevention

### PHASE 3: SECONDARY DRIVERS - THE SPECIFICS

**4. SECONDARY DRIVER DEVELOPMENT**
Break each primary driver into 2-4 actionable components:
- **For "Reliable Risk Assessment" Primary Driver:**
  * Standardized assessment tool implementation
  * Assessment frequency and timing protocols
  * Documentation and communication systems
  * Risk stratification and response algorithms
- **Specificity Test:**
  * Can a team take action on this?
  * Is it measurable?
  * Does it clearly support the primary driver?
- **Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
  * Too vague ("improve communication")
  * Too broad ("enhance culture")
  * Not actionable ("increase awareness")

### PHASE 4: CHANGE IDEAS - THE ACTIONS

**5. CHANGE IDEA GENERATION**
Develop multiple testable interventions per secondary driver:
- **Brainstorming Prompts:**
  * What's working elsewhere? (benchmark practices)
  * What does the evidence suggest?
  * What do frontline staff recommend?
  * What quick wins are available?
  * What system redesigns are needed?
- **Change Idea Categories:**
  * **Standardization:** Protocols, checklists, order sets
  * **Technology:** EMR tools, alerts, dashboards
  * **Education:** Training, simulation, competencies
  * **Redesign:** Workflow changes, role modifications
  * **Engagement:** Incentives, recognition, feedback
- **Prioritization Criteria:**
  * Impact potential (high/medium/low)
  * Implementation effort (easy/moderate/difficult)
  * Evidence strength (strong/moderate/emerging)
  * Resource requirements (minimal/moderate/significant)

### PHASE 5: VISUAL CONSTRUCTION

**6. DIAGRAM LAYOUT &amp; DESIGN**
Create clear visual representation:
- **Standard Format:**
  ```
  AIM ← PRIMARY DRIVER ← SECONDARY DRIVER ← CHANGE IDEAS
  ```
- **Visual Hierarchy:**
  * Aim: Large box on right
  * Primary Drivers: Medium boxes, color-coded
  * Secondary Drivers: Smaller boxes, grouped
  * Change Ideas: Bullet points or small boxes
- **Connection Rules:**
  * Clear lines showing relationships
  * No orphaned elements
  * Logical flow from left to right

### PHASE 6: TESTING &amp; REFINEMENT

**7. DIAGRAM VALIDATION**
Ensure completeness and logic:
- **Vertical Logic Test:**
  * Do change ideas clearly support secondary drivers?
  * Do secondary drivers enable primary drivers?
  * Do primary drivers achieve the aim?
- **Horizontal Completeness:**
  * Are all important factors addressed?
  * Any critical gaps?
  * Redundancies to eliminate?
- **Stakeholder Review:**
  * Clinical staff validation
  * Leadership alignment
  * Patient/family perspective
  * Support service input

**8. MEASUREMENT INTEGRATION**
Align measures with diagram elements:
- **Outcome Measure:** Linked to aim
- **Process Measures:** One per secondary driver minimum
- **Balancing Measures:** Monitor unintended consequences
- **Driver Measures:** Track primary driver achievement

### PHASE 7: IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING

**9. PDSA CYCLE MAPPING**
Plan testing sequence:
- **Wave 1:** Quick wins and high-impact/low-effort changes
- **Wave 2:** Moderate complexity interventions
- **Wave 3:** System redesigns and culture shifts
- **Timeline:** Map PDSA cycles across 3-6 month periods

**10. RESOURCE &amp; CAPABILITY PLANNING**
Identify requirements for success:
- **Team Composition:** Who needs to be involved?
- **Time Allocation:** Protected time for improvement work
- **Budget Needs:** Materials, technology, training
- **Skill Development:** QI training, data analysis capability
- **Executive Support:** Sponsorship and barrier removal
