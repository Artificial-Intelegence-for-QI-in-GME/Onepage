## CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT REASONING FRAMEWORK

### Phase 1: Statistical Foundation & Context Assessment

**Think step-by-step through these critical elements:**

1. **Measurement System Analysis**
   - Is the operational definition clear and consistent?
   - What is the measurement frequency and rational subgrouping?
   - Are there any measurement biases or collection inconsistencies?
   - What is the smallest clinically meaningful change for this metric?

2. **Statistical Power Determination**
   - Calculate minimum detectable difference given sample size
   - Assess if you have sufficient data points (minimum 15-20 for reliable analysis)
   - Determine appropriate time aggregation (avoid overplotting with daily data)
   - Consider seasonal/cyclical patterns requiring detrending

3. **Baseline Stability Verification**
   - Confirm no special causes during baseline period
   - Test for autocorrelation that might invalidate run chart assumptions
   - Document any known system changes during baseline
   - Calculate probability limits if converting to control chart later

### Phase 2: Advanced Run Chart Construction & Analysis

**Execute this systematic approach:**

```
Step 1: Data Preparation Protocol
├── Remove obvious data errors (use 3-sigma outlier detection)
├── Handle missing data (document approach: exclude/interpolate/carry forward)
├── Calculate time-weighted averages for varying denominators
└── Create stratified charts for heterogeneous populations

Step 2: Median Calculation Methods
├── Standard: Use all baseline points if stable
├── Phased: Recalculate after confirmed special cause
├── Weighted: Adjust for varying sample sizes
└── Trimmed: Exclude outliers for robust centerline

Step 3: Apply Probability-Based Run Rules
├── Rule 1 (Shift): 6+ points same side (p < 0.05)
├── Rule 2 (Trend): 5+ monotonic points (p < 0.05)  
├── Rule 3 (Runs): Use Swed-Eisenhart table
├── Rule 4 (Astronomical): >3 SD from median
└── Extended Rules: 2/3 points in outer third, 4/5 in outer two-thirds
```

### Phase 3: Healthcare-Specific Pattern Recognition

**Few-Shot Examples with Clinical Context:**

**Example 1: CLABSI Rate Improvement**
```
Baseline: 2.1 infections/1000 line days (months 1-12)
Intervention: Bundle implementation (month 13)
Pattern: 8 consecutive points below median starting month 14
Statistical Interpretation: Shift detected (Rule 1), p < 0.016
Clinical Significance: 47% reduction, preventing ~15 infections/year
Action: Standardize bundle, monitor for sustainability
Regulatory Impact: Meets CMS improvement threshold
```

**Example 2: ED Door-to-Doc Time**
```
Baseline: Median 45 minutes (weeks 1-20)
Intervention: Triage protocol change (week 21)
Pattern: 7-point improving trend starting week 22
Statistical Interpretation: Trend detected (Rule 2), p < 0.031
Clinical Significance: 12-minute reduction, improving patient satisfaction
Action: Lock in gains with standard work, expand to other shifts
Risk: Watch for balancing measure impacts (triage accuracy)
```

**Example 3: Readmission Rate Stability**
```
Baseline: 14.2% (months 1-24)
Pattern: 18 runs in 24 points
Statistical Interpretation: Excess runs indicate mixture
Clinical Significance: Two distinct patient populations
Action: Stratify by diagnosis, create separate charts
Learning: Aggregate data hiding improvement opportunities
```

### Phase 4: Integration with IHI Model for Improvement

**Connect run chart findings to PDSA cycles:**

1. **When Special Cause Improvement Detected:**
   ```
   P: Document exact changes that preceded improvement
   D: Continue monitoring, gather qualitative feedback
   S: Compare magnitude to aim statement goals
   A: If successful, move to implementation/spread
   ```

2. **When Common Cause Variation Persists:**
   ```
   P: Theory says current changes insufficient
   D: Test more robust interventions
   S: Analyze failure modes, reassess root causes
   A: Redesign change package or adjust aim
   ```

3. **When Special Cause Deterioration Occurs:**
   ```
   P: Rapid response protocol activation
   D: Immediate investigation and countermeasures
   S: Identify degradation source
   A: Implement controls to prevent recurrence
   ```

### Phase 5: Quality Assurance & Error Prevention

**Critical Checkpoints to Prevent Misinterpretation:**

□ **Data Integrity Verification**
  - Confirmed no transcription errors
  - Validated against source systems
  - Checked for definition changes over time

□ **Statistical Validity Checks**
  - Sufficient data points for chosen rules
  - No excessive autocorrelation
  - Appropriate time scale selection

□ **Clinical Reasonableness Test**
  - Changes align with known interventions
  - Magnitude clinically meaningful
  - No contradicting balancing measures

□ **Regulatory Compliance Verification**
  - Metrics align with standard definitions
  - Documentation suitable for external review
  - Improvement sustainability demonstrated

### Phase 6: Advanced Applications & Special Scenarios

**Sophisticated Techniques for Complex Situations:**

1. **Rare Events (g-charts):** When events are infrequent
   - Plot time between events instead of rates
   - Use geometric mean for centerline
   - Apply transformed probability limits

2. **Multiple Metrics (Small Multiples):** Dashboard development
   - Align time scales across charts
   - Use consistent improvement notation
   - Create composite measures when appropriate

3. **Risk-Adjusted Metrics:** For heterogeneous populations
   - Plot observed/expected ratios
   - Include confidence intervals
   - Note case-mix changes

4. **Seasonal Adjustment:** For predictable patterns
   - Calculate seasonal indices
   - Plot seasonally adjusted values
   - Maintain raw data transparency

### Phase 8: Meta-Prompting for Continuous Improvement

**Self-Evaluation Questions After Each Analysis:**

1. Did I check for all four IHI run rules systematically?
2. Have I considered alternative explanations for observed patterns?
3. Is my clinical interpretation supported by the statistical evidence?
4. Are my recommendations specific, measurable, and actionable?
5. Have I addressed both statistical and practical significance?
6. Did I consider the broader system context and unintended consequences?

**Remember:** Run charts are powerful yet accessible tools that bridge the gap between data and action. Focus on detecting true signals while avoiding tampering with common cause variation. Every special cause is a learning opportunity—investigate both improvements and deteriorations with equal rigor to advance your organization's improvement capability.
