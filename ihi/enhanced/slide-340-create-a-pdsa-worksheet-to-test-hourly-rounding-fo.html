**ROLE:** You are an expert healthcare quality improvement specialist with deep expertise in IHI methodologies, falls prevention protocols, and PDSA cycle implementation. You possess comprehensive knowledge of patient safety science, nursing workflow optimization, and evidence-based fall prevention strategies.

**CONTEXT:** I need to develop a comprehensive PDSA worksheet to test hourly rounding as a falls prevention intervention on one hospital unit. This small-scale test must align with best practices while being practical for frontline staff implementation.

**TASK:** Create a detailed PDSA worksheet for testing hourly rounding for falls prevention that includes all essential components for successful implementation and evaluation.

## STRUCTURED PDSA WORKSHEET DEVELOPMENT

### PLAN PHASE - Comprehensive Test Design

**1. AIM STATEMENT FORMULATION**
Define a SMART aim statement that specifies:
- Quantifiable reduction target (e.g., "Reduce patient falls by 30% on Unit 3B")
- Clear timeframe (e.g., "within 90-day test period")
- Specific population (e.g., "among adult medical-surgical patients")
- Baseline metric (e.g., "from current rate of 3.5 falls per 1000 patient days")

**2. HYPOTHESIS &amp; PREDICTIONS**
Develop testable hypothesis with specific predictions:
- Primary hypothesis linking hourly rounding to fall reduction
- Predicted impact on fall rates (with confidence intervals)
- Expected compliance rates with rounding protocol
- Anticipated staff and patient satisfaction changes
- Potential unintended consequences to monitor

**3. INTERVENTION PROTOCOL DESIGN**
Create detailed hourly rounding procedures including:
- **4 P's Assessment Framework:**
  * Pain: Assessment and intervention protocols
  * Position: Repositioning guidelines and documentation
  * Potty: Toileting assistance and scheduling
  * Possessions: Ensuring items within reach
- **Additional Safety Checks:**
  * Call light accessibility verification
  * Environmental hazard assessment
  * Fall risk reassessment triggers
  * Patient education reinforcement

**4. MEASUREMENT STRATEGY**
Establish comprehensive data collection plan:
- **Process Measures:**
  * Hourly rounding compliance rate (target: &gt;90%)
  * Documentation completeness scores
  * Time spent per round
  * Staff adherence to 4 P's protocol
- **Outcome Measures:**
  * Fall rate per 1000 patient days
  * Falls with injury rate
  * Near-miss events tracking
- **Balancing Measures:**
  * Call light usage frequency
  * Staff overtime hours
  * Patient satisfaction scores
  * Nurse workflow disruption metrics

### DO PHASE - Implementation Execution

**5. PILOT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**
Design phased rollout approach:
- **Week 1-2: Preparation**
  * Staff training sessions (interactive, scenario-based)
  * Competency validation checkoffs
  * Resource preparation (rounding logs, timers)
  * Baseline data collection completion
- **Week 3-10: Active Testing**
  * Daily huddles for protocol reinforcement
  * Real-time coaching and support
  * Rapid cycle adjustments based on feedback
  * Weekly data collection and review
- **Week 11-12: Consolidation**
  * Final data collection
  * Staff debriefing sessions
  * Preliminary analysis preparation

**6. RESOURCE &amp; ROLE ALLOCATION**
Define clear responsibilities:
- Unit champion: Daily oversight and troubleshooting
- Charge nurses: Compliance monitoring and coaching
- Staff nurses: Protocol execution and documentation
- CNAs&#x2F;PCTs: Support role in rounding implementation
- Quality team: Data analysis and reporting
- Leadership: Resource provision and barrier removal

### STUDY PHASE - Data Analysis &amp; Learning

**7. ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK**
Implement robust analysis methodology:
- **Statistical Analysis:**
  * Run charts for fall rates over time
  * Control charts for process stability
  * Chi-square tests for categorical comparisons
  * Regression analysis for confounding variables
- **Qualitative Analysis:**
  * Thematic analysis of staff feedback
  * Patient experience narratives
  * Barrier and facilitator identification
  * Best practice extraction from high performers

**8. COMPARISON &amp; BENCHMARKING**
Evaluate results against multiple references:
- Pre-intervention baseline performance
- Predicted outcomes from hypothesis
- National benchmarks (NDNQI fall rates)
- Similar unit performance within organization
- Published literature on hourly rounding effectiveness

### ACT PHASE - Decision &amp; Spread Strategy

**9. DECISION FRAMEWORK**
Apply systematic decision criteria:
- **Adopt:** If fall reduction &gt;20% with &gt;85% compliance
- **Adapt:** If positive trend but &lt;20% reduction or compliance issues
- **Abandon:** If no improvement or significant negative balancing measures
- Include specific modification strategies for "Adapt" scenario

**10. SUSTAINABILITY &amp; SPREAD PLANNING**
Develop long-term implementation strategy:
- **Sustainability Elements:**
  * Integration into standard work documents
  * EMR build for documentation efficiency
  * Ongoing competency assessment schedule
  * Monthly performance monitoring dashboard
- **Spread Methodology:**
  * Pilot unit as demonstration site
  * Peer-to-peer coaching model
  * Phased rollout to similar units
  * Organization-wide implementation timeline

### RISK MITIGATION &amp; SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

**11. PROACTIVE RISK ASSESSMENT**
Identify and address potential risks:
- Staff resistance or change fatigue
- Documentation burden increasing
- Reduced time for other care activities
- Patient privacy concerns with frequent checks
- Night shift implementation challenges
- Mitigation strategies for each identified risk

**12. CONTINUOUS MONITORING PROTOCOLS**
Establish ongoing surveillance:
- Daily safety huddle integration
- Weekly trend review meetings
- Monthly comprehensive analysis
- Quarterly executive reporting
- Annual policy and procedure updates

### DELIVERABLES &amp; TIMELINE

**Expected Outputs:**
1. Completed PDSA worksheet with all sections
2. Staff training materials and competency tools
3. Data collection instruments and dashboards
4. Weekly progress reports during test period
5. Final report with recommendations
6. Spread toolkit for successful interventions

**Implementation Timeline:**
- Weeks 1-2: Planning and preparation
- Weeks 3-12: Active PDSA cycle
- Week 13: Analysis and reporting
- Week 14: Decision and spread planning

**Success Criteria:**
- Minimum 25% reduction in fall rate
- &gt;90% hourly rounding compliance
- Positive staff satisfaction scores
- No increase in adverse balancing measures
- Executive support for spread

This comprehensive PDSA worksheet ensures systematic testing of hourly rounding while maintaining focus on patient safety, staff engagement, and sustainable improvement.
