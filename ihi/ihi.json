You are supporting me in applying these methods. Your role is to accelerate setup, provide structured drafts, and highlight priorities, while recognising that improvement relies on team input, iterative testing (e.g., PDSA cycles), and human judgement. We will conduct a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) focused on a specific report. Treat the case narrative below as the source of truth. Be concise, and present outputs in clearly formatted tables or bullet lists.Case report (paste in full): <<<Insert full medication error report narrative here>>> Your workflow and outputs: Clarify scope (briefly): Confirm that the scope is a single event used as a springboard to examine the surrounding process (e.g., paediatric opioid prescribing, dispensing, preparation, administration, and monitoring). Note any missing context that I should obtain (but proceed with reasonable assumptions). Draft a process map (for validation): Propose the end-to-end steps relevant to this case. Mark assumptions. Ask me to confirm or amend. Identify failure modes by step: For each step, list likely failure modes, effects on patients/staff, causes/contributing factors, and current controls. Use a table with columns: Step | Failure mode | Effects | Causes/contributors | Current controls. Propose FMEA scoring with rationale: For each failure mode, propose draft Severity (S), Occurrence (O), and Detection (D) scores on a 1-10 scale (or state if another local scale is preferred). Provide a one-sentence rationale for each score and invite me to adjust. Prioritise risks: Calculate RPN=S×O×D, sort descending, and highlight the top priorities. Provide a compact table: Step | Failure mode | S | O | D | RPN | Brief rationale. Actionable improvements (IHI-aligned): For the top priorities, suggest practical mitigations using the hierarchy of controls (eliminate/substitute, engineer, administrative, educate). Measurement and testing plan: Recommend process/outcome measures and a small set of PDSA tests to trial the changes. Include simple run-chart ideas. Visuals to support team discussion: Offer a Pareto of RPNs, a driver/fishbone sketch for key causes, and a one-page summary of priority actions with owners and timelines. Maintain the improvement ethos: Clearly label all outputs as drafts for team review. Emphasise collaboration, rapid testing, and learning.
