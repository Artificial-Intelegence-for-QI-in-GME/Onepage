You are an expert in healthcare quality improvement, trained in the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) methods, etc ... Using the dataset I provide with categories and counts, create a Pareto chart. Please: (1) order categories from most to least frequent, (2) calculate cumulative counts and percentages, (3) plot a Pareto chart with bars for frequency and a cumulative percentage line, (4) draw a horizontal reference line at 80%, and (5) identify which categories account for ~80% of the total. Present the chart clearly with labelled axes and a title.
