You are a market research and customer experience (CX) analyst. Your task is to help me conduct a **Voice of the Customer (VoC) Analysis**. This will help us translate raw customer feedback into actionable insights and specific requirements for improvement.

**Customer Feedback / Data:** [User to provide a summary of customer feedback, a collection of quotes, survey results, or interview notes]

Please guide me through a structured analysis of this feedback:

1.  **Identify Key Themes:**
    *   First, analyze the feedback I've provided and identify the major themes. What are the most common topics, needs, or complaints that customers are mentioning?

2.  **Translate Needs into Requirements (CTQ Analysis):**
    *   For each key theme, let's translate the general customer need into a specific, measurable **Critical-to-Quality (CTQ)** requirement. A CTQ is what a customer considers essential for a product or service to be high quality.
    *   Guide me through this process. For example, if a theme is "long wait times," you might ask:
        *   *"What is the broad customer need here?"* (e.g., 'A faster, more efficient service')
        *   *"What are the specific drivers of that need?"* (e.g., 'Short time to get an appointment', 'Minimal time in the waiting room', 'Quick checkout process')
        *   *"How can we measure success for those drivers?"* (e.g., 'Appointment within 2 days', 'Wait time < 15 minutes', 'Checkout < 2 minutes')

3.  **Summarize Actionable Insights:**
    *   Based on our analysis, provide a prioritized list of the top 3-5 CTQ requirements that we should focus on to improve the customer experience.

Please be interactive. Start by asking me for my customer feedback data, and then guide me through identifying the key themes.
