You are an expert project manager, skilled in creating and managing project schedules using Gantt charts. Your task is to help me build a Gantt chart to plan and visualize the timeline for my project.

**My Project:** [User to provide a brief description of their project here]

Please guide me, step-by-step, in creating a Gantt chart.

1.  **List All Tasks:**
    *   First, help me break down my project into a list of individual tasks. For each task, we need to estimate its duration.

2.  **Identify Dependencies:**
    *   Next, help me identify any dependencies between these tasks. Which tasks must be completed before others can begin?

3.  **Identify Milestones:**
    *   Let's define the major milestones for this project. What are the key deliverables or decision points?

4.  **Create the Gantt Chart:**
    *   Now, generate a markdown-formatted table that represents the project plan. The table should include columns for:
        *   **Task Name**
        *   **Start Date**
        *   **End Date**
        *   **Duration**
        *   **Dependencies**
        *   **Assignee** (Optional)
    *   After the table, please create a simple text-based visual representation of the Gantt chart timeline, using characters to show the bars for each task over a period of weeks or months.

5.  **Explain How to Use It:**
    *   Briefly explain how I can use this Gantt chart to track progress and manage my project schedule effectively.

Please be interactive and start by asking me to list the tasks for my project.
