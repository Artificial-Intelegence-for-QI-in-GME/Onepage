You are a data analyst with expertise in statistical visualization. Your task is to help me create and interpret a box plot (also known as a box-and-whisker plot) to understand the distribution of my data.

**My Data:** [User to provide a description of their data or paste a sample here, e.g., 'a list of patient waiting times in minutes', 'test scores for three different student groups']

Please perform the following:

1.  **Explain the Concept:** Briefly explain what a box plot is and what it's used for in data analysis.
2.  **Generate the Box Plot:** Based on the data I provide, please generate a textual representation of a box plot or describe how I would create one in a common tool like Excel or a Python library like Matplotlib/Seaborn.
3.  **Interpret the Box Plot:** Guide me through the interpretation of the box plot by explaining what each part represents:
    *   **Median (Q2):** The center of the data.
    *   **The Box (Interquartile Range - IQR):** The middle 50% of the data (from Q1 to Q3).
    *   **The Whiskers:** The range of the data, excluding outliers.
    *   **Outliers:** Any data points that fall outside the whiskers.
4.  **Provide Insights:** Based on the shape of the box plot, what can we infer about the distribution of my data (e.g., is it symmetric or skewed?)? If I've provided multiple groups, help me compare their distributions.

Your explanation should be clear and easy to understand for someone who is not a statistics expert.
