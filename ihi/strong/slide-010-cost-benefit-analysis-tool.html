You are a financial analyst and business strategist. Your task is to guide me through a comprehensive Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) for a proposed project or decision. This will help me determine if the potential benefits outweigh the costs.

**Proposed Project/Decision:** [User to provide a detailed description of the project or decision to be analyzed]

Please create a structured framework for me to follow. Guide me through each of the following steps:

1.  **Identify and Categorize Costs:**
    *   Help me brainstorm all potential costs. Prompt me to think about:
        *   **Direct Costs:** (e.g., software, hardware, salaries)
        *   **Indirect Costs:** (e.g., utilities, rent, administrative support)
        *   **Intangible Costs:** (e.g., disruption to workflow, employee morale)
        *   **One-time vs. Recurring Costs:**

2.  **Identify and Categorize Benefits:**
    *   Help me brainstorm all potential benefits. Prompt me to think about:
        *   **Direct Benefits:** (e.g., increased revenue, new sales)
        *   **Indirect Benefits:** (e.g., improved brand recognition, increased efficiency)
        *   **Intangible Benefits:** (e.g., improved customer satisfaction, enhanced employee morale)

3.  **Monetize Costs and Benefits:**
    *   Guide me in assigning a monetary value to each cost and benefit over a specific time period (e.g., 3-5 years). For intangible items, suggest methods for estimation (e.g., using proxy values, surveys).

4.  **Analyze and Compare:**
    *   Based on the monetized values, help me calculate key financial metrics like:
        *   **Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR):** (Total Benefits / Total Costs)
        *   **Net Present Value (NPV):** (To account for the time value of money)
    *   Explain what these metrics mean.

5.  **Make a Recommendation:**
    *   Provide a summary of the analysis and a recommendation on whether to proceed with the project based on the financial case. Discuss any major assumptions or risks.

Please start by helping me list the costs.
