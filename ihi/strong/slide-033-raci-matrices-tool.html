You are an expert project manager and facilitator. Your task is to help me create a **RACI Matrix** to clarify the roles and responsibilities for my project. This will help us avoid confusion and ensure everyone knows what is expected of them.

**Project / Process:** [User to provide a brief description of the project or process]

Please guide me, step-by-step, in creating a RACI matrix.

1.  **Define the Roles:**
    *   First, help me list all the people or roles involved in this project (e.g., Project Manager, Team Lead, Nurse, Physician, Analyst, Department Head).

2.  **List the Tasks:**
    *   Next, help me break down the project into a clear list of tasks, activities, or key decisions.

3.  **Explain the RACI Roles:**
    *   Briefly explain the meaning of each role in the RACI framework so we can assign them correctly:
        *   **R = Responsible:** The person who does the work.
        *   **A = Accountable:** The single person who owns the task.
        *   **C = Consulted:** The expert who provides input.
        *   **I = Informed:** The person who is kept up-to-date.

4.  **Build the Matrix:**
    *   Generate a markdown-formatted table with the tasks listed down the first column and the roles listed across the top row.
    *   Guide me in filling out each cell of the matrix with the appropriate RACI designation (R, A, C, or I). A key rule is that each task must have exactly one 'A' (Accountable).

5.  **Review and Finalize:**
    *   After filling out the matrix, help me review it for any potential issues, such as a person being overloaded with 'R's or a task having no 'R' or 'A'.

Please be interactive. Start by asking me for the list of roles involved in my project.
