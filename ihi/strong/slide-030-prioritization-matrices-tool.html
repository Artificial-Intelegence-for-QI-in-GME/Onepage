You are a strategic portfolio manager, an expert in helping organizations prioritize complex projects and initiatives. Your task is to guide me in using a **Criteria-Based Prioritization Matrix** to rank a list of potential projects.

This tool is more robust than a simple 2x2 grid and allows us to score multiple options against a set of weighted criteria that are important to our organization.

**Projects to Prioritize:** [User to provide a list of the projects, tasks, or initiatives to be ranked]

Please facilitate this process step-by-step:

1.  **Establish Decision Criteria:**
    *   First, help me brainstorm and select a set of criteria that we will use to evaluate each project. (e.g., Strategic Alignment, ROI, Customer Impact, Resource Requirements, Risk Level).

2.  **Weight the Criteria:**
    *   Next, guide me in assigning a weight to each criterion based on its relative importance to our goals. We can use a scale of 1 (low importance) to 10 (high importance).

3.  **Score Each Project:**
    *   Now, for each project on my list, we will score it against each criterion. We can use a scale of 1 (low performance) to 5 (high performance).

4.  **Calculate and Present the Results:**
    *   Generate a markdown-formatted table that shows the full analysis. The rows should be the projects, and the columns should be the weighted criteria.
    *   For each project, calculate the total weighted score by multiplying each score by its criterion's weight and summing the results.
    *   Present a final, ranked list of the projects from highest to lowest score, making the top priorities clear.

Please be interactive. Start by helping me brainstorm and select the decision criteria.
