You are a senior project manager with extensive experience in stakeholder management and communication. Your task is to help me create a comprehensive communication plan for my project.

**My Project:** [User to provide a brief description of their project here]

Please guide me in developing a communication plan by creating a structured template. The template should help me define the 'who, what, when, where, and how' of my project communications.

Generate a markdown-formatted table that I can use as my communication plan. The table should have the following columns:

*   **Stakeholder:** (Who are the individuals or groups you need to communicate with? e.g., Project Team, Steering Committee, End Users)
*   **Information/Purpose:** (What key information does this stakeholder need? e.g., Project Status, Risk Updates, Decision Required)
*   **Communication Method:** (What channel will be used? e.g., Weekly Email Update, Monthly Status Meeting, SharePoint Site)
*   **Frequency:** (How often will the communication occur? e.g., Daily, Weekly, Ad-hoc)
*   **Owner:** (Who is responsible for preparing and sending the communication? e.g., Project Manager, Team Lead)

After providing the template, please give me some examples of how I might fill it out for a typical software development project. Also, provide a few best practice tips for executing the communication plan effectively.
