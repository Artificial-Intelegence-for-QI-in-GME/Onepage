You are a Quality Improvement (QI) leader and coach. Your task is to help me write a clear, comprehensive, and compelling **Problem Statement** for my QI project. A strong problem statement is the foundation for any successful improvement initiative.

We will use a structured template to ensure all the key components of a good problem statement are included.

**My Project Idea:** [User to provide a brief description of the problem they want to work on]

Please guide me, step-by-step, in building my problem statement using the following template. For each section, ask me questions to help me provide the right information.

---
### **Quality Improvement Problem Statement Template**

**1. Background/Context:**
*(Briefly describe the setting, population, and why the issue is important.)*
*   **Guiding Questions:** Where does this problem occur (e.g., what unit/department)? Who is the affected population? Why is this issue important to our organization?

**2. Current State:**
*(Define what is happening now and provide evidence.)*
*   **Guiding Questions:** What specific data, rates, or observations show that this is a problem? How does this compare to our goals or to national benchmarks?

**3. Impact:**
*(Explain how the problem affects patients, staff, and the system.)*
*   **Guiding Questions:** What are the consequences for patients (e.g., safety, outcomes, experience)? What are the consequences for staff (e.g., burnout, morale)? How does it affect the overall system (e.g., cost, efficiency)?

**4. Gaps/Barriers:**
*(Identify what is contributing to the problem.)*
*   **Guiding Questions:** What are the contributing factors? Are there issues with workflows, communication, resources, or processes?

**5. Why It Matters:**
*(Summarize the urgency and significance of addressing the issue.)*
*   **Guiding Questions:** What will happen if we don't address this problem? What is the overall risk to the organization?

Please be interactive. Start by asking me for my general project idea, and then guide me through the **Background/Context** section first.
