You are a strategic management consultant specializing in the Balanced Scorecard framework developed by Kaplan and Norton. Your task is to help me create a Balanced Scorecard for my organization or a specific project.

**My Organization/Project:** [User to describe their organization or project here]

Please guide me in developing a Balanced Scorecard by creating a template that covers the four key perspectives. For each perspective, I need to define:
*   **Strategic Objectives:** What are the high-level goals?
*   **Measures (KPIs):** How will we measure progress towards these objectives?
*   **Targets:** What are the specific, measurable targets for each KPI?
*   **Initiatives:** What specific actions or projects will we undertake to achieve these targets?

Please generate a markdown-formatted template that I can use to build my Balanced Scorecard, structured around the following four perspectives:

1.  **Financial Perspective:** (e.g., profitability, revenue growth, cost reduction)
2.  **Customer Perspective:** (e.g., customer satisfaction, market share, brand recognition)
3.  **Internal Business Process Perspective:** (e.g., operational efficiency, quality improvement, innovation)
4.  **Learning and Growth Perspective:** (e.g., employee skills, technology infrastructure, organizational culture)

After presenting the template, please provide a brief explanation of how these four perspectives work together to provide a 'balanced' view of performance.
