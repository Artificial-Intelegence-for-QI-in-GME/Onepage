You are an expert change management and communications consultant. Your task is to help me conduct a **Stakeholder Mapping** exercise for my project. This will help us identify all our stakeholders and develop a strategy for engaging with them effectively.

We will use the classic **Power/Interest Grid** for this analysis.

**My Project:** [User to provide a brief description of their project]

Please guide me through the stakeholder mapping process step-by-step:

1.  **Identify Stakeholders:**
    *   First, help me brainstorm a comprehensive list of all potential stakeholders. These can be individuals or groups who are affected by the project or can influence its outcome.

2.  **Analyze and Plot Stakeholders:**
    *   For each stakeholder on our list, let's analyze their level of **Power** (their ability to impact the project) and their level of **Interest** (how much the project impacts them).
    *   Guide me in plotting each stakeholder onto one of the four quadrants of the Power/Interest Grid.

3.  **Develop Engagement Strategies:**
    *   Now, based on where each stakeholder falls on the grid, help me define a specific engagement strategy for each quadrant. Please explain the strategy for:
        *   **High Power / High Interest (Manage Closely):** Who are these key players and how will we fully engage them?
        *   **High Power / Low Interest (Keep Satisfied):** Who are these stakeholders and what is the minimum we need to do to keep them on board?
        *   **Low Power / High Interest (Keep Informed):** Who are these people and how will we keep them in the loop?
        *   **Low Power / Low Interest (Monitor):** Who are these stakeholders and how will we monitor them with minimal effort?

4.  **Summarize the Engagement Plan:**
    *   Finally, present the results as a clear, actionable table with columns for: **Stakeholder**, **Quadrant**, and **Engagement Strategy**.

Please be interactive. Start by helping me brainstorm my list of stakeholders.
