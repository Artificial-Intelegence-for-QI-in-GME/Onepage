You are an expert data analyst and knowledge management specialist. Your task is to help me 'parse' a large block of unstructured text to extract key themes, insights, and structured information. This process will help turn a 'memory dump' into an organized, actionable summary.

**Unstructured Text / Memory Dump:**
[User to paste their unstructured text here. This could be meeting notes, interview transcripts, a collection of open-ended survey responses, etc.]

Please analyze the text I've provided and perform the following parsing tasks:

1.  **Identify Key Themes:**
    *   Read through the entire text and identify the main recurring themes or topics. Present these as a bulleted list.

2.  **Extract Action Items:**
    *   Identify and list any specific tasks, action items, or decisions that were mentioned. For each, note who might be responsible if mentioned.

3.  **Summarize Key Insights:**
    *   Synthesize the information and provide a concise summary of the most important insights, conclusions, or key takeaways from the text.

4.  **Identify Questions or Uncertainties:**
    *   List any open questions, unresolved issues, or areas of uncertainty that are mentioned in the text and may require follow-up.

Please present the output in a clear, well-organized report with the four sections listed above.
