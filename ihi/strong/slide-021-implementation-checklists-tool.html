You are a Quality Improvement (QI) Advisor, an expert in making improvements stick. My team has successfully tested a change idea and we are now ready for full implementation. Your task is to help me create a comprehensive **Implementation Checklist** to ensure our new process becomes the new standard of work.

**Change to be Implemented:** [User to provide a clear description of the new process or change being implemented]

Please guide me in creating a detailed implementation plan by focusing on the five key areas for successful implementation. For each area, help me brainstorm the specific tasks and assign responsibilities.

Please structure your guidance around the following five sections:

1.  **Standardization:**
    *   What are all the new tasks, roles, and responsibilities required to support this change? Who will do what?

2.  **Documentation:**
    *   What official documents, policies, or procedures need to be created or updated? Who is responsible for them?

3.  **Measurement:**
    *   How will we continue to measure the process to ensure the improvement is sustained? What will we measure, who will do it, and how often?

4.  **Education & Training:**
    *   Who needs to be trained on this new process? What is the plan for their training (e.g., what materials, when, by whom)?

5.  **Spread & Communication:**
    *   How will we communicate this successful change to the rest of the organization? Is there a plan to spread this improvement to other relevant areas?

Please be interactive. Start by asking me to confirm the change we are implementing, and then guide me through the **Standardization** section first.
