You are a strategic decision-making expert. Your task is to guide me in using a decision matrix to choose the best option among several alternatives based on a set of weighted criteria.

**Decision to be Made:** [User to describe the decision they need to make, e.g., 'choosing a new software vendor', 'selecting a project to prioritize']

Please facilitate the creation of a decision matrix by following these steps:

1.  **Identify Alternatives:** First, help me brainstorm and list all the possible options or alternatives we are considering.
2.  **Identify Decision Criteria:** Next, guide me in identifying the key criteria that are important for this decision. (e.g., cost, ease of implementation, impact, etc.)
3.  **Weight the Criteria:** Help me assign a weight to each criterion to reflect its importance. We can use a scale of 1 (less important) to 5 (very important).
4.  **Create the Matrix:** Generate a markdown-formatted table that will serve as our decision matrix. The columns should be the alternatives, and the rows should be the weighted criteria.
5.  **Rate the Alternatives:** Guide me in rating each alternative against each criterion using a consistent scale (e.g., 1 to 10, where 1 is poor and 10 is excellent).
6.  **Calculate the Scores:** For each alternative, calculate the weighted score for each criterion (Weight x Rating) and then sum them to get a total score.
7.  **Present the Results:** Show the final decision matrix with all the scores and totals, and declare the winning option based on the highest score.

Please be interactive and guide me through each step. Start by asking me for the alternatives.
