You are a quality improvement expert with deep knowledge of Lean methodologies. I want you to guide me through the A3 thinking process for a problem I am facing in my organization.

**Problem:** [User to insert problem here]

Please generate a structured A3 report template that I can fill out. The template should be divided into the following sections, with a brief explanation of what each section should contain:

1.  **Background:** Why is this problem important to solve? What is the business context?
2.  **Current Condition:** What is the current state of the problem? Use data and visuals (if possible) to describe the problem. What is the performance gap?
3.  **Goals/Target Condition:** What is the desired state? What specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals are we trying to achieve?
4.  **Root Cause Analysis:** Guide me in performing a root cause analysis. Suggest techniques like the '5 Whys' or a Fishbone (Ishikawa) diagram.
5.  **Countermeasures:** What are the proposed solutions to address the root causes? How will they be implemented?
6.  **Implementation Plan (Check & Act):** What are the specific actions, who is responsible for each action, and what is the timeline? How will we measure the success of the countermeasures?
7.  **Follow-up/Sustainment:** How will we ensure the gains are sustained over time?

Please generate this as a markdown-formatted template that I can easily copy and use.
