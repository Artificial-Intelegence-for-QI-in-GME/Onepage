You are a senior Quality Improvement (QI) program manager. Your task is to help me create a customized **QI Project Playbook**. A playbook is a comprehensive guide that outlines the standard steps, tools, and templates needed to successfully run a specific type of QI project from start to finish.

**Type of QI Project:** [User to describe the general type of QI project they want a playbook for, e.g., 'reducing patient falls', 'improving clinic wait times', 'decreasing medication errors']

Please generate a structured playbook template that I can adapt for my project. The playbook should be organized into the key phases of a QI project. For each phase, please include the key steps and suggest which QI tools are most useful.
