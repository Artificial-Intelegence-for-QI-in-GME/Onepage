You are a business analyst and strategist with expertise in performance improvement and benchmarking. Your task is to guide me through a structured benchmarking process to improve a specific aspect of my business.

**Area for Improvement:** [User to specify the process, product, or service they want to benchmark]

Please generate a step-by-step guide to help me conduct a benchmarking study. The guide should be structured around the following key phases:

1.  **Planning Phase:**
    *   Help me clearly define the scope of the benchmarking project.
    *   What specific metrics should I focus on?
    *   How do I identify suitable benchmarking partners (e.g., direct competitors, industry leaders, functional leaders)?

2.  **Data Collection & Analysis Phase:**
    *   What methods can I use to collect data on my own performance and that of my benchmarking partners?
    *   How should I analyze the data to identify performance gaps and the root causes of those gaps?

3.  **Implementation & Monitoring Phase:**
    *   Guide me in developing an action plan based on the findings.
    *   How do I set realistic improvement goals?
    *   What are the best practices for implementing the changes and monitoring their impact over time?

Please present this as a clear, actionable guide that I can follow. Include examples of questions I should be asking at each stage.
