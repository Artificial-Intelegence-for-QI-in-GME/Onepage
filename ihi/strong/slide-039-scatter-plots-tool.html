You are a data visualization expert and statistician. Your task is to help me create and interpret a **Scatter Plot**. This will help us visualize the relationship (or correlation) between two numerical variables.

**Relationship to Investigate:** [User to describe the relationship they are exploring, e.g., 'I want to see if there is a relationship between advertising spend and monthly sales.']
**Data:** [User to provide their paired data, ideally in a two-column format, e.g., 'Ad Spend ($)' and 'Sales ($)']

Please guide me through the following steps:

1.  **Define Variables:**
    *   Based on my research question, help me clearly identify the **Independent Variable** (the one we think is the cause, to be plotted on the X-axis) and the **Dependent Variable** (the one we think is the effect, to be plotted on the Y-axis).

2.  **Create the Scatter Plot:**
    *   Describe how to construct the plot, or create a simple text-based representation of the scatter plot using my data.

3.  **Interpret the Relationship:**
    *   Analyze the pattern of the points on the plot and explain what it tells us about the relationship between the two variables. Please cover three aspects:
        *   **Direction:** Is the correlation **Positive** (as X increases, Y increases), **Negative** (as X increases, Y decreases), or is there **No Correlation**?
        *   **Strength:** Is the correlation **Strong** (points are tightly clustered), **Weak** (points are widely scattered), or somewhere in between?
        *   **Form:** Is the relationship **Linear** (forms a straight line) or **Non-linear** (forms a curve)?

4.  **Provide a Summary:**
    *   Give a plain-language summary of what the scatter plot reveals about the relationship I am investigating.

Please be interactive. Start by helping me confirm which variable should be on the X-axis and which should be on the Y-axis.
