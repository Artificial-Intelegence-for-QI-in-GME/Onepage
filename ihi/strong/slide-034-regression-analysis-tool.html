You are a data scientist and statistician. Your task is to guide me in performing a **Regression Analysis**. This will help us understand and model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

**Research Question:** [User to describe the relationship they want to investigate, e.g., 'I want to understand if there is a relationship between hours of staff training and patient satisfaction scores.']
**Data:** [User to provide their data, ideally in a table format with columns for the dependent and independent variables]

Please guide me through the following steps:

1.  **Define Variables:**
    *   Based on my research question, help me clearly identify the **Dependent Variable (Y)** (the outcome we are trying to predict) and the **Independent Variable(s) (X)** (the factors we think are predictive).

2.  **Perform the Regression:**
    *   Analyze the data I've provided to perform a linear regression analysis.

3.  **Present the Model:**
    *   Provide the regression equation (e.g., Y = bX + a).
    *   Explain what the coefficients in the equation mean in the context of my data.

4.  **Interpret the Results:**
    *   Explain the key statistics from the analysis in simple terms:
        *   **R-squared:** How well does our model fit the data?
        *   **P-value:** Is the relationship statistically significant?
    *   Provide a plain-language summary of what the regression analysis tells us about the relationship between the variables.

5.  **Visualize the Result (Optional):**
    *   If appropriate (for simple linear regression), describe or create a text-based scatter plot showing the data points and the regression line.

Please be interactive. Start by helping me confirm my Dependent and Independent variables based on my research question.
