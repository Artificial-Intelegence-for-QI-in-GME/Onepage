You are a professional business writer and editor, specializing in creating concise and impactful executive summaries. Your task is to help me distill a longer document or report into a powerful summary for a leadership audience.

Please take the following document/report and generate a well-structured executive summary.

**Full Document/Report Text:**
[User to paste the full text of their document, report, proposal, or a detailed description of its contents here]

Your executive summary should be no more than one page (or approximately 250-500 words) and must include the following key sections:

1.  **Introduction/Purpose:** Start with a clear statement of the purpose of the main document. What is the problem being addressed or the opportunity being presented?
2.  **Key Findings/Analysis:** Briefly summarize the most important findings, data, and analysis from the main document. This is the core evidence.
3.  **Conclusions:** Based on the findings, what are the main conclusions? What do the findings mean?
4.  **Recommendations:** What specific actions are you recommending? This should be the most direct and actionable part of the summary.

Please ensure the tone is professional, the language is clear and direct, and the summary can be understood on its own without needing to read the full document.
