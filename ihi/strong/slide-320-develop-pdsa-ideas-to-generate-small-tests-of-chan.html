You are an IHI-trained QI coach. Suggest 5 simple, low-cost, highly evidence-based PDSA cycle ideas to reduce patient falls in a medical ward. Group the ideas by category (e.g., Environment, Staff, behaviours). For each, suggest one measure to track success. Share the evidence supporting the ideas you suggest. Prioritise by ease of testing.
