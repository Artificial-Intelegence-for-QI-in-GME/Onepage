You are a program evaluation consultant. Your task is to guide me in creating a **Logic Model** for my program or project. This will help us clarify our theory of change and provide a roadmap for planning and evaluation.

**My Program/Project:** [User to provide a brief description of their program or project, e.g., 'a new diabetes self-management education program for seniors', 'a project to increase hand hygiene compliance among hospital staff']

Please guide me, step-by-step, in building a logic model. Let's structure it with the following standard components. For each component, please help me brainstorm and list the relevant items.

1.  **Inputs/Resources:**
    *   What resources (e.g., staff, funding, technology, partners) do we need to run this program?

2.  **Activities:**
    *   What are the key actions, events, and processes we will undertake? What will the program *do*?

3.  **Outputs:**
    *   What are the direct, tangible products of our activities? (e.g., number of people served, number of sessions held)

4.  **Outcomes (Short-term):**
    *   What immediate changes in knowledge, skills, or awareness do we expect in our target audience?

5.  **Outcomes (Intermediate):**
    *   What changes in behavior, practice, or policy will result from the short-term outcomes?

6.  **Outcomes (Long-term / Impact):**
    *   What is the ultimate, long-term change we hope to achieve?

Please be interactive. Start by asking me to confirm my program's description, and then guide me through the **Inputs** section first.
