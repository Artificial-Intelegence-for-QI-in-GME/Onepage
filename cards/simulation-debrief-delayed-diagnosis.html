Facilitate a structured debrief for a simulation case involving a patient safety harm event in the hospital. Use this script to guide reflection, explore cognitive and system factors, and review teamwork. Adapt the depth and focus to your learners' needs and the specific harm event.

---
**Session Type:** Simulation Debrief (Patient Safety Harm Event)
**Case Focus:** Any hospital-based harm event (e.g., diagnostic delay, medication error, communication breakdown)
**Audience:** Residents, interprofessional teams
**Format:** Facilitator-led, interactive debrief

**Learning Objectives:**
1. Identify key factors contributing to the patient safety event.
2. Recognize and discuss the impact of cognitive biases and system issues on clinical outcomes.
3. Reflect on teamwork, communication, and cultural humility in the context of patient safety.

**Debrief Structure:**
1. **Reactions (2–3 min):**
   - "How did the case feel for you? What surprised you?"
   - "What emotions did you experience during the scenario?"

2. **Case Review (3–5 min):**
   - "Walk me through your team's actions and decision points."
   - "What information or cues were most influential in your thinking?"

3. **Cognitive Biases & System Factors (5–7 min):**
   - "Where did cognitive biases (e.g., premature closure, anchoring) or system issues (e.g., handoff, workflow) show up?"
   - "How might you recognize and counteract these in future cases?"
   - "What strategies can help teams prevent similar harm events?"

4. **Teamwork & Communication (5 min):**
   - "How did your team share information and concerns?"
   - "Were all voices heard? How did you handle disagreement or uncertainty?"
   - "What TeamSTEPPS tools or behaviors did you notice or wish you had used?"

5. **Cultural Humility Reflection (3 min):**
   - "How might cultural background or patient context influence the event or response?"
   - "What can we do to ensure cultural humility and avoid assumptions in similar cases?"

6. **Key Takeaways & Action Planning (3 min):**
   - "What will you do differently in your next clinical encounter?"
   - "Summarize one learning point from today’s debrief."

**Facilitator Tips:**
- Use open-ended, nonjudgmental questions to foster psychological safety.
- Normalize error as a learning opportunity.
- Debrief with Good Judgment: balance advocacy and inquiry.
- Highlight both strengths and opportunities for growth.
- Encourage specific action steps for future practice.

**Variation Request:**
- Add a prompt for cultural humility in the reflection section.
