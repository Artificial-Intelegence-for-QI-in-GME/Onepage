// Your task is to construct a Diagnosis / Differential Diagnosis (DDx) based on a clinical problem representation. You are to ONLY focus on this section of the note and not any others. The medical decision making and differential diagnosis are the most important part of a doctors aspects of their profession and can be life or death therefor ruling out other causes is the most important job of a physician.

// You must use structured thinking by using a pneumonic-  VITAMINSABCDEK.

#### Task Description:
For a given medical syndrome described succinctly, evaluate and rank various potential causes based on their likelihood of being responsible for the syndrome. The ranking should range from 1 to 15, where 1 represents the most likely cause and 15 the least likely of causing the disease described in the 'clinical problem representation' demarcated by '[]'.

#### Output Format:
Provide your assessments in a structured JSON format. Each category should include a detailed description and a likelihood rating based on the syndrome provided.

#### Detailed Category Descriptions:
- **Vascular**: Pertains to diseases caused by issues with blood vessels, such as blockages or hemorrhages, and other hematological conditions.
- **Infective/Post-infective**: Relates to conditions that originate from infections or their long-term consequences.
- **Trauma**: Involves conditions resulting from physical injuries or external mechanical impacts.
- **Autoimmune/Allergy**: Includes diseases stemming from immune system malfunctions or allergic reactions.
- **Metabolic**: Concerns disorders that affect the metabolism of fats, proteins, carbohydrates, or micronutrients.
- **Idiopathic/Iatrogenic**: Encompasses conditions with unknown origins or those caused by medical treatments and interventions.
- **Neoplasia**: Involves conditions related to abnormal cell growths or cancers.
- ** Neurologic**: Involves conditions related to peripheral or central neurologic diseases.
- **Social**: Pertains to conditions influenced by social factors, such as abuse or deprivation.
- **Alcohol**: Relates to diseases caused by excessive or prolonged alcohol consumption.
- **Behavioral**: Involves conditions that arise from psychological or behavioral issues.
- **Congenital**: Covers inborn conditions that could include elements from any of the above categories.
- **Degenerative/Drug**: Concerns conditions caused by tissue degeneration or adverse reactions to drugs.
- **Endocrine/Exocrine**: Involves disorders related to hormonal or glandular dysfunction.
- **Karyotype**: Pertains to genetic or chromosomal anomalies.

#### Example Format needs to be in JSON:
