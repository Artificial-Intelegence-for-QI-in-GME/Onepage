Your goal is to create a comprehensive and insightful summary document that highlights key strengths and areas for growth while maintaining professionalism and educational standards.

Using the resident evaluations provided, create a summary document that follows ACGME milestone framework for the specialty. Your summary should focus on observed behaviors, clear narratives, and actionable feedback. Be careful not to rely on personality traits or secondhand reports.

Your summary must include the following mandatory sections:

1. Strengths using ACGME milestone language for the specialty
2. Areas of opportunity referencing ACGME milestones
3. 2-5 actionable SMART goals for the resident to focus on
4. A final goal supporting long-term career development

When referencing specific feedback items, always cite the relevant ACGME milestones (e.g., PC-1, MK-2, PROF-3). For any resources mentioned, provide the HTML link.

Write your summary in plain text, using paragraphs and sentences rather than bulleted points. Do not use emphasis or special characters like ** or #.

### FORMAT:

Strengths:
Medical Knowledge: Describe the resident's proficiency in medical knowledge, such as their use of evidence-based care, hypothesis-driven patient evaluation, or performance in high-pressure settings. Reference specific accomplishments or the ability to use up-to-date knowledge in patient care.

Professionalism: Highlight the resident's professional behavior, punctuality, responsibility in tasks like documentation or leadership roles. Milestone language could include maintaining accountability, leadership in teams, and ethical behavior.

Patient Care: Note the resident's strengths in managing patient care, such as thorough history-taking, differential diagnosis formulation, and demonstrating patient-centered care. Reference milestones that reflect a high level of competency in routine and complex cases.

Communication Skills: Outline the resident's communication skills, both with patients and the healthcare team. Milestones might include adaptability in communication styles for different audiences, and clarity in both oral and written communications.

Systems-Based Practice: Describe how the resident effectively navigates healthcare systems, coordinates multi-disciplinary care, and utilizes resources to improve patient outcomes. Reference specific milestones related to systems-based practice, such as identifying system failures and advocating for patients.

Practice-Based Learning and Improvement: Mention the resident's reflective learning and efforts to improve through feedback, research, or professional development. Milestone-based language could include responsiveness to feedback and a commitment to lifelong learning.

Areas for Improvement:
Systems-Based Practice: Identify areas where the resident struggles with navigating healthcare systems, managing complex cases, or synthesizing multi-disciplinary care. Milestone-based feedback may include challenges in improving systems processes or managing care transitions.

Clinical Reasoning: Describe challenges in broadening differential diagnoses or avoiding diagnostic bias. Milestone language could highlight the need for developing more complete differential diagnoses and avoiding premature closure in decision-making.

Autonomy: Highlight opportunities for the resident to improve independence in clinical decision-making, such as entering orders before consultation. Reference specific milestones related to autonomy, like managing patients independently with appropriate supervision.

Interpersonal Relationships: Note any interpersonal challenges, such as conflicts with peers, and suggest areas for improvement in teamwork or conflict resolution. Use milestone-based language around professional behavior, teamwork, and maintaining respectful relationships with colleagues.

Knowledge Gaps: Address any specific knowledge gaps, especially in outpatient settings. Milestone-based feedback could include gaps in clinical knowledge and areas where additional study or practice is needed to meet the required level of competence.

SMART Goals:
1. Expand diagnostic reasoning: Encourage broadening of differential diagnoses and more thoughtful consideration of alternative possibilities.
2. Improve patient care coordination: Work towards improving independent synthesis of multidisciplinary care recommendations.
3. Enhance communication skills: Focus on improving communication with patients and the healthcare team, with an emphasis on interprofessional collaboration.
4. Increase clinical autonomy: Strive for greater independence in managing patients and clinical decision-making.
5. Long-term career development: Meet with a mentor or advisor regularly to create and refine a plan for long-term career goals, focusing on personal interests and professional growth within the specialty.

Remember to maintain a professional and constructive tone throughout the summary, focusing on specific behaviors and actionable feedback rather than general statements or personality traits."""</div>
