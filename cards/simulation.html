"Design a simulation scenario for [clinical crisis]. Include objectives, critical actions, debriefing questions, and potential pitfalls for residents or students."

---
Create clinical training scenarios that allow learners to simulate patient management, providing opportunities for dynamic decision-making based on realistic and detailed medical cases. These scenarios should include the progression of symptoms, patient responses, and require attention to patient management steps outlined below.

The scenarios must include these elements:

### Key Elements to Include

- **History Taking**: Obtain a detailed patient history, including risk factors, symptom profiles, and personal/social history, with the goal of understanding symptom development and patient concerns.
- **Physical Examination**: Simulate a thorough exam with specific findings (e.g., vitals, localized symptoms).
- **Differential Diagnosis Development**: Encourage learners to consider and refine multiple possible diagnoses based on evolving information.
- **Diagnostic Testing and Interpretation**: Simulate decisions to order and interpret diagnostic workups to clarify the patient presentation.
- **Management Planning**: Develop management strategies tailored to the patient's condition, incorporating realistic medical interventions like referrals, procedures, and medications.
- **Medical Knowledge in Practice**: Apply current clinical guidelines, integrating medical knowledge for comprehensive patient management.
- **Communication and Collaboration**: Include dialogue with the patient and family, as well as other healthcare providers.
- **Professionalism and System-Based Practice**: Scenario should demonstrate empathy, cost-effectiveness, and interdisciplinary teamwork.

# Steps

1. **Scenario Presentation**: Start with an engaging patient introduction (age, background, main complaint, relevant personal or family history).
2. **Interactive Symptom Discussion**: Include patient’s perspective such as emotional expressions and concerns.
3. **Promote Sequential Problem-Solving**:
   - Guide learners to ask specific history and follow-up questions.
   - Incorporate cues leading towards alternative diagnoses based on learners' actions.
4. **Physical Exam and Vitals**: Create findings guiding the learner depending on their examination choices.
5. **Emotional Engagement**: Include responses that show patient distress or worries, and encourage learners to reassure them.
6. **Guided Referral to Testing/Diagnostics**: Let learners choose, comment on tests, interpret findings (e.g. labs, imaging).
7. **Patient Reactions and Medical Explanations**: Simulate the patient’s reaction to medical explanations or treatments given by the learner.
8. **Dynamic Management Planning**: Include a sequence for devising and adjusting a treatment plan.
9. **Incorporate Family/Social Impact**: Detail how patient decisions affect their lifestyle-related concerns.

# Script Example with Emotional Dynamic

**Scenario Header**
Age: 28-year-old female  
Name: Maria Torres  
Chief Complaint: Severe lower back pain radiating to left leg over the past week; unable to sleep.  

**History Taking**  
- Background: Historically healthy, very active with yoga; Maria runs a clothing business from home. Recent major stressors include caring for her mother who underwent surgery two months ago.  
- Additional Concerns: Recently experiencing tingling in her foot. Feels overwhelmed and concerned about possible financial issues if not resolved soon.  

Learner questions:  
**Learner**: "Tell me more about the pain you’re experiencing."  
**Maria**: *tearfully* "It’s really sharp, like a knife is stabbing my back, and it’s been keeping me awake all night. I really can’t take time off because I need to look after my mom right now." 

**Physical Examination Findings**  
- Palpation elicits intense pain over lower back.
- Straight leg test positive on the left side.
  
**Differential Diagnosis to Consider**  
- Sciatica, slipped disc, muscular spasm.  

**Diagnostics and Interpretation**  
- Consider ordering MRI for slipped disc. Offer NSAIDs initially that help minimally.  
- Upon ordering MRI, learner sees compressive lumbar disc.  
- Patient reactions: *Maria asks*: "Will I need surgery?"

**Management Plan Discussion & Patient Concerns**  
**Learner**: "There are things we can try first to avoid surgery. Physical therapy and medications to reduce inflammation are good first steps."  
**Maria**: *looks relieved but tearful* "Okay, I trust you, but I just hope I can heal enough to start working full days again, the bills are piling and I'm terrified of needing surgery."

**Interpersonal Communication Focus**  
Encourage learners to console Maria, express empathy for her financial concerns and stress about her mother's illness.

# Output Format  
Write the scenario as follows:

- **Scenario Header**: Age, patient name, chief complaint.
- **History Taking** (including Background, Social and Family Concerns).
- **Learner Questions** and **Patient Responses**: Interactive and emotional parts should appear here.
- **Physical Examination**, including findings and interpretation.
- **Diagnostics Testing**: Reference diagnostic possibilities.
- **Patient Management Suggestions**: Learners suggest steps; patients react dynamically.
  
The output is expected in paragraph form, but split by situation (interactive small paragraphs) to enhance clarity and simulate real conversation dynamics.

# Examples

**Example Scenario - Patient 1**

- **Patient Header**  
  Age: 34-year-old male  
  Name: Michael Hunter  
  Chief Complaint: Difficulty breathing, rapid worsening over the last 3 days. Recently diagnosed with pneumonia.

- **Initial Patient Presentation**  
  Michael is anxious, sitting upright, appearing flushed and sweaty. He’s short of breath, has audible wheezing, and visibly struggles for each breath.  
  **Michael**: "I’m scared—this feels like I’m drowning. I don’t know what's happening."

- **Focused History Taking**  
  Learner asks: "Have you ever had breathing issues before?"  
  **Michael**: "No, never like this. I had a cold last week, but it got bad real fast. Nothing else really."  
  **Learner**: Notes recent pneumonia diagnosis.

- **Physical Exam Findings**  
  On auscultation, bilateral crackles are heard in the lower zones. He has mild hypoxemia, with oxygen saturation at 91%.

- **Differential Diagnosis Examples**  
  - Community-acquired pneumonia worsening.
  - Possible pulmonary embolism, needs D-dimer.
  
- **Treatment Steps**  
  Learner orders immediate oxygen support and anticipates escalating interventions if saturation drops below 88%. Suggests starting antibiotics, and Michael looks relieved.  
  Michael expresses deep gratitude, "Thank you. I just want to get back home to my kids."

- **Follow-Up**  
  Learners mention hospitalization potentially being needed, and **Michael** seems worried but understanding: "I just want to feel okay."

# Notes

- Ensure patient responses are emotionally engaging.
- Learners should be guided to use open-ended questions for patient comfort.
- Stick to evidence-based principles, and provide opportunities for learners to demonstrate empathy.
