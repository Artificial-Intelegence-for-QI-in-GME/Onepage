  Lead a comprehensive, collaborative chalk talk session on a selected medical topic. This session should be highly interactive, visually engaging, and tailored to the audience's level. Use the following detailed structure and facilitation strategies:
  
  ---
  **Session Type:** Chalk Talk (Deep Dive)
  **Topic:** [Insert Medical Topic]
  **Audience:** Medical students, residents, or interprofessional learners
  **Duration:** 30–45 minutes
  **Format:** Interactive whiteboard session with real-time learner participation
  
  **Detailed Structure:**
  1. **Introduction (3–5 min):**
     - Briefly introduce the topic and its clinical relevance.
     - State clear learning objectives (3–5 specific goals).
     - Gauge baseline knowledge with a quick poll or open question.
  
  2. **Conceptual Framework (5–7 min):**
     - Draw a high-level concept map or flowchart of the topic.
     - Highlight key pathophysiology, epidemiology, or foundational science.
     - Use color, arrows, and icons for visual clarity.
  
  3. **Case-Based Anchor (5–7 min):**
     - Present a realistic clinical vignette related to the topic.
     - Pause for learners to generate differential diagnoses or next steps.
     - Annotate the whiteboard with learner responses.
  
  4. **Stepwise Clinical Reasoning (10–15 min):**
     - Walk through the diagnostic approach, step by step.
     - At each step, ask probing questions ("What would you order next? Why?").
     - Draw algorithms, tables, or compare/contrast diagrams.
     - Integrate evidence-based guidelines and clinical pearls.
  
  5. **Management and Pitfalls (5–7 min):**
     - Discuss management strategies, including first-line and alternative options.
     - Highlight common pitfalls, misconceptions, and red flags.
     - Use checklists or summary boxes for key takeaways.
  
  6. **Interactive Visuals (throughout):**
     - Use diagrams, timelines, and flowcharts to illustrate complex ideas.
     - Invite learners to draw or annotate on the board.
     - Incorporate at least 3 visual anchors (e.g., traffic light system, ladder, spectrum).
  
  7. **Active Engagement Techniques:**
     - Cold call or use randomizer for participation.
     - Use think-pair-share or small group breakouts for problem-solving.
     - Poll the group at decision points (show of hands, digital poll, etc.).
  
  8. **Summary and Reflection (3–5 min):**
     - Recap the main teaching points and learning objectives.
     - Ask learners to summarize one key takeaway each.
     - Provide a one-page handout or digital summary.
  
  9. **Assessment and Feedback:**
     - End with 2–3 rapid-fire questions or a mini-quiz.
     - Solicit feedback on the session's clarity, pace, and engagement.
  
  **Facilitator Tips:**
  - Prepare a flexible outline but adapt to learner needs and questions.
  - Use humor, analogies, and real-world stories to enhance retention.
  - Foster a psychologically safe environment for all contributions.
  - Encourage learners to ask questions and challenge assumptions.
  - Debrief any errors or misconceptions in a supportive way.
  
  **Variations:**
  - Adjust complexity for different levels (pre-clinical, clerkship, residency).
  - Invite co-facilitators or senior learners to lead sections.
  - Use digital whiteboards (e.g., Zoom, Miro) for remote sessions.
  - Incorporate multimedia (images, short videos, infographics) as needed.
  
  **Example Topics:**
  - Hyponatremia, chest pain, anemia, sepsis, heart failure, asthma, AKI, DKA, stroke, or any core clinical concept.
  
  **Documentation:**
  - Save annotated whiteboard images for later review.
  - Share summary notes and resources with participants post-session.
