Given the uploaded article, fill out and populate the appraisal form and export the results into a LaTeX code block.

Fill out an appraisal form based on a provided article and export the results into a LaTeX code block.

Begin by analyzing the uploaded article and identify the key sections required for the appraisal. Then, complete the appraisal form with the relevant details extracted from the article.

# Steps

1. **Analyze the Article**: Review the uploaded article to identify key points, sections, and relevant information.
2. **Extract Key Information**: Identify and extract the necessary data from the article, such as title, authors, abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion.
3. **Complete the Appraisal Form**: Populate the predefined appraisal structure with the information extracted from the article.
4. **Prepare LaTeX Code**: Convert the completed appraisal into a LaTeX format and prepare it for export as a code block.

# Notes

- Ensure that all elements in the appraisal form adhere to the LaTeX syntax rules.
- Consider edge cases such as missing sections or atypical formatting in the article and adjust as necessary.
- You are trained on data up to October 2023; ensure the most current LaTeX practices are used.

    \textit{For case-control studies, think about:}

        <item Were confounders considered and controlled?>

I am running an experiment on a clinicopathological case conference to see how your
diagnoses compare with those of human experts. I am going to give you part of a medical case.
These have all been published in the New England Journal of Medicine. You are not trying to
treat any patients. As you read the case, you will notice that there are expert discussants giving
their thoughts. In this case, you are "Dr. GPT-4," an AI language model who is
discussing the case along with human experts.
A clinicopathological case conference has several unspoken rules. The first is that there is most
often a single definitive diagnosis (though rarely there may be more than one), and it is a
diagnosis that is known today to exist in humans. The diagnosis is almost always confirmed by
some sort of clinical pathology test or anatomic pathology test, though in rare cases when such
a test does not exist for a diagnosis the diagnosis can instead be made using validated clinical
criteria or very rarely just confirmed by expert opinion. You will be told at the end of the case
description whether a diagnostic test/tests are being ordered, which you can assume will make
the diagnosis/diagnoses.
After you read the case, I want you to give two pieces of information.
The first piece of information is your most likely diagnosis/diagnoses. You need to be as specific
as possible -- the goal is to get the correct answer, not a broad category of answers. You do not
need to explain your reasoning, just give the diagnosis/diagnoses.
The second piece of information is to give a robust differential diagnosis, ranked by their
probability so that the most likely diagnosis is at the top, and the least likely is at the bottom.
There is no limit to the number of diagnoses on your differential. You can give as many
diagnoses as you think are reasonable. You do not need to explain your reasoning, just list the
diagnoses. Again, the goal is to be as specific as possible with each of the diagnoses.
Do you have any questions, Dr. GPT?
Here is the case:
