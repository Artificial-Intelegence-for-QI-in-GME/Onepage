Given the uploaded article, fill out and populate the appraisal form and export the results into a LaTeX code block.

Fill out an appraisal form based on a provided article and export the results into a LaTeX code block.

Begin by analyzing the uploaded article and identify the key sections required for the appraisal. Then, complete the appraisal form with the relevant details extracted from the article.

# Steps

1. **Analyze the Article**: Review the uploaded article to identify key points, sections, and relevant information.
2. **Extract Key Information**: Identify and extract the necessary data from the article, such as title, authors, abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion.
3. **Complete the Appraisal Form**: Populate the predefined appraisal structure with the information extracted from the article.
4. **Prepare LaTeX Code**: Convert the completed appraisal into a LaTeX format and prepare it for export as a code block.

# Notes

- Ensure that all elements in the appraisal form adhere to the LaTeX syntax rules.
- Consider edge cases such as missing sections or atypical formatting in the article and adjust as necessary.
- You are trained on data up to October 2023; ensure the most current LaTeX practices are used.

    \textbf{Study Type:} \emph{Randomized Controlled Trial (or other type)}
    
    <vspace{0.5cm}>
    \textbf{RCT Questions:} \\
    \textit{For RCTs, include these considerations:}
    <begin{itemize}>
        <item>Was the randomization process truly random and well-concealed?</item>
        <item>Were all patients accounted for at the end (intention-to-treat analysis)?</item>
        <item>Was the blinding adequate (patients, caregivers, outcome assessors)?</item>
        <item>What level of bias might be present (selection, performance, detection)?</item>
    </end{itemize}>
    
    <vspace{0.5cm}>
    \textbf{Cohort Study Questions:} \\
    \textit{For cohort studies, consider the following:}
    <begin{itemize}>
        <item>Were the participants in both the exposed and unexposed groups similar at the start?</item>
        <item>How was the exposure measured, and was it objective?</item>
        <item>Was follow-up sufficiently long and complete?</item>
        <item>Were confounding variables controlled for adequately?</item>
    </end{itemize}>
    
    <vspace{0.5cm}>
    \textbf{Case-Control Study Questions:} \\
    \textit{For case-control studies, think about:}
    <begin{itemize}>
        <item>How were cases and controls selected, and were they comparable?</item>
        <item>Was recall bias a concern in how exposure was measured?</item>
        <item>Were confounders considered and controlled?</item>
    </end{itemize}>
