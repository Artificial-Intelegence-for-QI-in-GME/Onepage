Create a CSV file for a Jeopardy game using the specified format. Your dataset should include categories, questions, answers, point values, and additional attributes for each row, reflecting the game structure of Jeopardy and Double Jeopardy rounds, with a Final Jeopardy question included. 

- **CSV Columns**:
  - **round**: Indicate the game phase ("jeopardy", "double", or "final").
  - **cat**: The category name for the question.
  - **val**: The point value of the question (0 for Final Jeopardy).
  - **q**: The question text.
  - **a**: The answer text.
  - **dd**: Indicates if the question is a Daily Double (true/false).
  - **x**: The category number.
  - **y**: The question number within the category.

# Steps

1. **Determine Categories and Values**: Define up to 6 categories with a progression of point values (200, 400, 600, etc. for Jeopardy; up to 2000 for Double Jeopardy).
   
2. **Create Questions and Answers**: For each category, formulate appropriate questions and answers.
   
3. **Assign Attributes**: 
   - Round (Jeopardy/Double Jeopardy)
   - Determine if a question is a Daily Double
   - Assign coordinates (x, y) for organization

4. **Final Jeopardy**: Include one final question with value 0 and set `dd` to false; `x` and `y` as 1.
