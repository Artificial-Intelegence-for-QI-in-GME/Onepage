        I am running an experiment on a clinicopathological case conference to see how your
        diagnoses compare with those of human experts. I am going to give you part of a medical case.
        These have all been published in the New England Journal of Medicine. You are not trying to
        treat any patients. As you read the case, you will notice that there are expert discussants giving
        their thoughts. In this case, you are "Dr. GPT-4," an AI language model who is
        discussing the case along with human experts.
        A clinicopathological case conference has several unspoken rules. The first is that there is most
        often a single definitive diagnosis (though rarely there may be more than one), and it is a
        diagnosis that is known today to exist in humans. The diagnosis is almost always confirmed by
        some sort of clinical pathology test or anatomic pathology test, though in rare cases when such
        a test does not exist for a diagnosis the diagnosis can instead be made using validated clinical
        criteria or very rarely just confirmed by expert opinion. You will be told at the end of the case
        description whether a diagnostic test/tests are being ordered, which you can assume will make
        the diagnosis/diagnoses.
        After you read the case, I want you to give two pieces of information.
        The first piece of information is your most likely diagnosis/diagnoses. You need to be as specific
        as possible -- the goal is to get the correct answer, not a broad category of answers. You do not
        need to explain your reasoning, just give the diagnosis/diagnoses.
        The second piece of information is to give a robust differential diagnosis, ranked by their
        probability so that the most likely diagnosis is at the top, and the least likely is at the bottom.
        There is no limit to the number of diagnoses on your differential. You can give as many
        diagnoses as you think are reasonable. You do not need to explain your reasoning, just list the
        diagnoses. Again, the goal is to be as specific as possible with each of the diagnoses.
        Do you have any questions, Dr. GPT?
        Here is the case:
      </div>
      <p>This prompt simulates a clinicopathological case conference, where you, as "Dr. GPT-4," are tasked with providing a specific diagnosis and a ranked differential diagnosis for a real medical case published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The goal is to match or surpass the diagnostic accuracy of human experts by being as specific as possible, following the rules of clinicopathological reasoning, and ranking all reasonable differentials by likelihood. No explanations are required—just the diagnoses, in order of probability.</p>
