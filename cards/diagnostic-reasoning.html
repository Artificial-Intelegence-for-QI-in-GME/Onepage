      <h3>Diagnostic Reasoning</h3>
      <p style="font-size: 0.98em; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #444;">
        Practice clinical reasoning: use VINDICATE for differential diagnosis, spot red flags, and explain your diagnostic pathway.<br>
        You will reason out using differential diagnosis, intuitive reasoning, analytic reasoning, and Bayesian inference.

        <em>demo_example_CoT</em> = [{'question':'Shortly after undergoing a bipolar prosthesis for a displaced femoral neck fracture of the left hip acquired after a fall the day before, an 80-year-old woman suddenly develops dyspnea. The surgery under general anesthesia with sevoflurane was uneventful, lasting 98 minutes, during which the patient maintained oxygen saturation readings of 96–100% on 8 L of oxygen. She has a history of hypertension, osteoporosis, and osteoarthritis of her right knee. Her medications include ramipril, naproxen, ranitidine, and a multivitamin. She appears cyanotic, drowsy, and is oriented only to person. Her temperature is 38.6°C (101.5°F), pulse is 135/minute, respirations are 36/min, and blood pressure is 155/95 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 81%. There are several scattered petechiae on the anterior chest wall. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 10.5 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 9,000/mm3, a platelet count of 145,000/mm3, and a creatine kinase of 190 U/L. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia. What is the most likely diagnosis?','answer': 'Fat embolism', 'rationale': 'The patient had a surgical repair of a displaced femoral neck fracture.  The patient has petechiae.  The patient has a new oxygen requirement, meaning they are having difficulty with their breathing.  This patient most likely has a fat embolism'}, {'question': 'A 55-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a dry cough and severe chest pain beginning that morning. Two months ago, he was diagnosed with inferior wall myocardial infarction and was treated with stent implantation of the right coronary artery. He has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. His medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, and enalapril. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 92/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows a high-pitched scratching sound best heard while sitting upright and during expiration. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows diffuse ST elevations. Serum studies show a troponin I of 0.005 ng/mL (N < 0.01). What is the most likely cause of this patients symptoms?', 'answer': 'Dresslers Syndrome', 'rationale': 'This patient is having chest pain.  They recently had a heart attack and have new chest pain, suggestig he may have a problem with his heart.  The EKG has diffuse ST elevations and scratching murmur.  This patient likely has Dressler Syndrome.'}]<br><br>
