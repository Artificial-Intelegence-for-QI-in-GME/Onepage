# IHI Enhanced Prompt Improvement Strategy

## Executive Summary
**Critical Issue Identified:** The current "enhanced" prompts are using generic, overly broad templates that don't match the specific task requirements. Many enhanced prompts are actually WORSE than the strong versions because they're verbose, unfocused, and don't address the actual user need.

## Current State Analysis

### Problems with Existing Enhanced Prompts
1. **Generic Template Overuse**: Most enhanced prompts use the same boilerplate "Comprehensive Healthcare Quality Improvement Initiative" template regardless of the specific task
2. **Context Mismatch**: A simple Excel formula request gets the same complex framework as a full QI initiative
3. **Loss of Specificity**: The enhanced versions often lose the specific, actionable instructions present in the strong versions
4. **Cognitive Overload**: Excessive structure and bullet points make prompts harder to follow
5. **Missing Task Focus**: Enhanced prompts don't actually enhance the core task - they just add generic healthcare compliance language

### Comparison Examples

#### Example 1: Excel Formula Help (Slide 311)
- **Weak**: Basic request for formula
- **Strong**: Specific, actionable - asks for formula, explanation, dynamic version, and visualization steps
- **Enhanced (Current)**: Generic QI framework that completely ignores the Excel formula request
- **Enhanced (Should Be)**: Should build on the strong version with chain-of-thought reasoning, example data, error handling, and statistical considerations

#### Example 2: Near Miss Explanation (Slide 318)
- **Weak**: Write 3-sentence explanation
- **Strong**: Adds role (patient communication specialist), example requirement, and learning focus
- **Enhanced (Current)**: Generic QI framework unrelated to writing a simple explanation
- **Enhanced (Should Be)**: Should add health literacy principles, multiple examples, cultural sensitivity, and structured output format

## Comprehensive Enhancement Strategy

### Core Principles for Enhanced Prompts

1. **Task-Appropriate Enhancement**
   - Match complexity to task requirements
   - Build upon strong prompt strengths, don't replace them
   - Maintain focus on the specific deliverable

2. **Modern Prompt Engineering Techniques**
   - Chain-of-thought reasoning for complex analysis
   - Few-shot examples for pattern demonstration
   - Role-based expertise with specific credentials
   - Structured output templates for consistency
   - Multi-step workflows for comprehensive tasks
   - Constraint specification for quality control

3. **Healthcare-Specific Enhancements**
   - Evidence-based practice integration where relevant
   - Regulatory compliance only when applicable
   - Patient safety considerations when appropriate
   - Clinical accuracy and terminology precision

```

### 6. Constraint Specification
```
"Ensure your response:
- Uses terminology appropriate for [audience]
- Stays within [word/time limit]
- Addresses [specific regulatory requirements]
- Includes [required elements]
- Avoids [common pitfalls]"
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Categorization and Assessment (Cards 1-77)
1. Read each card's weak and strong versions
2. Categorize into one of the 5 categories (A-E)
3. Assess current enhanced version quality
4. Identify specific enhancement opportunities
5. Document in tracking spreadsheet

### Phase 2: Template Development
1. Create category-specific enhancement templates
2. Develop reusable prompt components library
3. Build technique application guidelines
4. Create quality checklist for each category

### Phase 3: Systematic Enhancement (Cards 1-77)
1. Apply appropriate enhancement techniques based on category
2. Ensure enhanced version builds upon strong version
3. Validate clinical accuracy and appropriateness
4. Test for clarity and actionability
5. Document improvements made

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance
1. Review enhanced prompts for consistency
2. Validate healthcare domain accuracy
3. Test with sample scenarios
4. Gather feedback from domain experts
5. Iterate based on findings

### Phase 5: Documentation and Integration
1. Update all HTML files with improved prompts
2. Create usage guidelines for each prompt type
3. Document best practices learned
