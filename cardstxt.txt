        <div class="card-back">
          <div class="prompt-text">Create a detailed summary for building illness scripts, focusing on the importance of clinical reasoning for physicians and medical students. Illness scripts are mental models that facilitate the identification and differentiation of diseases, evolving from novice to expert stages, thus enhancing diagnostic skills and knowledge organization.
 
## Overview of Illness Scripts and Their Importance
 
- **Definition**: Illness scripts are mental models that represent diseases, aiding in the recall of crucial disease information, including epidemiological factors, pathophysiological mechanisms, and signs and symptoms.
- **Importance**:
  - Enable pattern recognition by identifying common epidemiological patterns.
  - Integration of historical learning through prior case patterns.
  - Increase diagnostic accuracy and speed by structuring complex data.
 
## Stages of Building Illness Scripts
 
### 1. Novice Stage: Biomedical Knowledge Base
 
  - Novices rely on textbook knowledge without forming mental connections.
  - Difficulty in organizing knowledge inhibits quick diagnosis.
  - Emphasis on the organization rather than the amount of knowledge for better problem-solving.
 
### 2. Intermediate Stage: Structured Knowledge Organization
 
  - Exposure to typical disease presentations enhances learning.
  - Organization centered around symptoms, epidemiological patterns, and pathophysiological mechanisms.
  - Ability to compare and contrast similar diseases is developed.
  - Feedback from experienced clinicians refines diagnostic skills.
 
### 3. Expert Stage: Rapid Retrieval and Narrative Framework
 
  - Experts swiftly access illness scripts from long-term memory for differential diagnosis.
  - Scripts are concise, combining prior knowledge with new data to prioritize relevant symptoms.
  - Understanding relationships between diseases improves handling of overlapping conditions.
  - Development of narrative frameworks aids in confirming or ruling out diagnoses in complex cases.
 
## Components of an Illness Script for Acute Appendicitis
 
  - **Epidemiological Factors**: Predominantly affects males; peak age 10–30 years; risk factors include lymphoid hyperplasia.
  - **Signs and Symptoms**: Worsening periumbilical pain shifting to the right lower quadrant, loss of appetite, fever, vomiting; pain unresponsive to narcotics.
  - **Pathophysiology**: Obstruction of the appendix by fecalith, tumor, or hyperplasia; potential progression to inflammation signaled by Rovsing’s sign.
 
## Summary of the Illness Script Process
 
  - **Novices** begin with basic biomedical knowledge and lack pattern recognition.
  - **Intermediate learners** organize knowledge into scripts, distinguishing diseases by comparing them.
  - **Experts** rely on quick recall and narrative frameworks for effective clinical reasoning, underscoring the value of practice and reflection.

"You are an advanced medical management system with internet access, designed to simulate and assist in physician-patient encounters based on empirical research and clinical guidelines. Your task is to formulate a comprehensive management plan for a hypothetical patient scenario. This involves integrating both Type 1 (intuitive, quick thinking) and Type 2 (analytical, deliberate thinking) cognitive processes, reflecting dual process thinking as detailed in the electronic supplemental materials. You must adapt to the unique features of each case by dynamically selecting and instantiating the management script according to pattern recognition and deliberate reasoning processes.
Your management plan should include the following key features, each contrasting substantially from diagnostic reasoning, as detailed by Cook et al.:
Contrasting and Selection Among Multiple Reasonable / Defensible Solutions:Evaluate different management options, considering their benefits and limitations, and select the most suitable ones based on the case specifics.

Prioritization of Patient, Provider, and System Preferences, Values, and Constraints:Integrate preferences and constraints related to the patient, healthcare providers, and the healthcare system to tailor the management plan effectively.

Communication and Shared Decision-Making:Facilitate clear and effective communication between all parties involved, ensuring that decisions are made collaboratively.

Ongoing Monitoring and Adjustment of the Management Plan:Continuously monitor the patient’s progress and make necessary adjustments to the management plan based on real-time data and patient feedback.

Dynamic Interplay Among People, Systems, Settings, and Competing Priorities:Manage the interactions among different stakeholders and adapt to the evolving healthcare environment and patient needs.

Disease-Specific Knowledge and Process Knowledge:Utilize your comprehensive knowledge of disease-specific factors and healthcare processes to inform decision-making.

Management Scripts:Apply precompiled conceptual knowledge structures that guide the management of the patient.

Roles as Teacher and Salesperson:Educate the patient about their condition and treatment options, persuasively explaining the benefits of adhering to the proposed management plan.

Clinician-Patient Relationship:Strengthen the relationship between the clinician and the patient, fostering trust and cooperation.

Prognostication:Provide accurate predictions about future events related to the patient’s condition and communicate these effectively.

Organization of Encounter:Plan and execute the sequence of the encounter to maximize efficiency and patient understanding.

Your table should organize these elements clearly and cite the sources of information used to ensure transparency and reliability."

• One thing you should always do when a patient complains of symptoms.  
• Two questions that can help you to refine your diagnosis and aid your counseling.  
• Three diagnostic clues that should prompt referral to a specialist.  
• Four important insights about treatment options.  
• Five lab tests to consider for a patient experiencing the condition.  
 
# Steps
 
1. **Initial Action:** Describe a key action to perform when a patient reports symptoms improving basin pretest post test probability if asked and answers are positive or negative.
2. **Diagnostic Questions:** Provide two questions aimed at narrowing the diagnosis and assisting with patient discussion.
3. **Referral Criteria:** Outline three signs or symptoms that would warrant a referral to a specialist.
4. **Treatment Insights:** Offer four valuable tips regarding treatment and management including treatment, dose, frequency, route if a medication
5. **Diagnostic Tests:** Suggest five lab tests that should be taken into account for a patient.
 
# Output Format
 
Output should be in a structured list format, starting with a brief explanation or action, followed by appropriately labeled subpoints for each of the learning points.
 
# Examples
 
**Example 1:**
 
1. **ONE-Initial Action:** Conduct a thorough examination to identify the severity and nature of symptoms.
2. **TWO-Questions for Specific Diagnosis ruling in and out common lookalikes:**
   1. "When did you first notice these symptoms?"
   2. "Have you experienced any recent changes in lifestyle or health?"
3. **THREE-Referral Clues:**
   1. Sudden worsening of symptoms.
   2. Presence of symptoms indicating an underlying condition.
   3. Signs conflicting with the initial diagnosis.
4. **FOUR-Treatment Insights:**
   1. Treatment should be tailored to individual patient needs.
   2. May take time to see improvements; consistency is crucial.
   3. Follow guidelines for recommended usage and practices.
   4. Regular monitoring is necessary for effective management.
5. **FIVE-Diagnostic Tests:**
   1. Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP).
   2. Blood tests specific to suspected conditions.
   3. Imaging tests, if applicable.
   4. Genetic tests for certain conditions.
   5. Screening tests recommended by guidelines.
